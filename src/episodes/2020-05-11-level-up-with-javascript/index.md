description: "JavaScript is notorious for being one of the most popular, yet also one of the most despised programming languages to learn, so today we’re covering some of the intermediate and advanced JavaScript concepts! We’ll discuss convoluted topics like generators, prototypal inheritance, and the rendering engine.

Knowing intermediate JavaScript concepts like the call stack, context, scope, the prototype chain, higher order functions, async programming, and the event loop is invaluable and will help with learning frameworks. The fundamentals won't change even if the ecosystem does."

# Sponsors

A huge thank you to our sponsors for supporting the LadyBug Podcast! Interested in becoming a Ladybug Podcast sponsor? Head over to our Contact page for more details.

AWS Amplify is a suite of tools and services that enables developers to build full stack serverless and cloud-based web and mobile apps using their framework or technology of choice on the front end.

Using Amplify you can quickly get up and running with things like hosting, authentication, managed GraphQL, serverless functions, APIs, machine learning, chat bots, and storage for files like images, videos, and pdfs.

Amplify is built especially in a way to enable traditionally front-end developers to be successful because they can use their existing skillset to build real-world full stack apps that in the past would require deep knowledge around back end, dev ops, and scalable infrastructure.

The Amplify Console then allows you to use a Github repository to deploy to a globally available CDN, with CI and CD built in.

How often have you struggled to learn programming because you just couldn’t find the right resource to suit your learning style? I struggled for nearly a year before stumbling upon a website known as Frontend Masters. I’ve been a long-time paid user of the online learning platform simply because I find the courses to be comprehensive and beginner-friendly. They have the best teachers in the tech industry and they’re one of the reasons I was able to land my dream job.

With Frontend Masters you can learn web development, responsive design, back-end development, animations, testing, algorithms, data structures and more. You can pick a course you’re interested in or follow one of the learning paths like React, Vue, Angular, data visualization with D3, node.js and more.
