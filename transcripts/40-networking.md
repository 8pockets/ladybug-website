Today we're talking about Routing and Switching starting with layer one of the OSI model. Let's dig in. Just kidding. I don't know anything about that kind of networking. But we are talking about networking today. Networking is a really great opportunity to meet new people in the same industry, learn new skills and develop your career. This week, we're talking all things not working, why do we not work, how to network and what to do if you're really not that into networking? Let's jump in. Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly.

Okay, so let's just talk about how we prefer to network first before we dig into like why networking is important and stuff. What is your favorite way to network? I

**Emma**  1:29  
primarily network through Twitter, I have a very active LinkedIn account with 2000 pending requests in my inbox that I am putting off they'll populate what I find I'm at the point with my LinkedIn where I have gotten recruiter messages through there. I think that's how I found my job at LogMeIn. But unfortunately, now she's just so chaotic with all these connections with people that I don't actually know. And so I'm kind of like, Huh, well, maybe this isn't the best place to network, and that's why I primarily use Twitter. Actually the spot of By job that I've just accepted, I was referred internally through an engineering manager through Twitter. It's a really great way to network. And I also that's how I got my Google interview as well. So that's my primary method of networking. What about you, Alex? Um,

**Ali**  2:14  
I would probably agree with Twitter, but also in person meetups. I think that those have also been really pivotal for me. And then of course conferences to innovate a lot of those but I think most success on Twitter. That being said, I think my most success as far as getting jobs has been networking with people at previous jobs. I've gotten most of my jobs through former co workers that have moved on to other companies and then me following them, so

Unknown Speaker  2:44  
yeah, useful. So be

**Ali**  2:45  
nice to your co Yeah, be nice to your co workers network with them. You're already there with them all day every day, so may as well make friends with them. Right.

**Kelly**  2:54  
Exactly. Tell me about you. So I do some networking through Twitter. Especially Like in the Shopify community, I am currently working on building my LinkedIn following. I'm posting a lot on there. As you know, it's more business II and since I run a business, I guess I figure it's probably an okay place to spend some time. Still getting overusing hashtags on LinkedIn. I've had people call me out for not using hashtags on my LinkedIn post, saying, you'll get so much more engagement with them and like I hate hashtags and think it is hate them because of Twitter. Anyway, that's a tangent. And then conferences for me. So specifically, Shopify related conferences, I'm not really big on like general tech meetups.

**Emma**  3:40  
Yeah, really quickly. I know, this wasn't something we necessarily planned to talk about. So this is a little bit off the cuff. But I want to discuss really quickly, maybe some of the problems with networking sites like LinkedIn. I really like LinkedIn. I've worked with them as a company. I created a course on LinkedIn learning and they're all fantastic, but I do see several problems. With the community on their platform, you know, a lot of times as a woman I have been flirted with on these platforms, I've been contacted for personal reasons that weren't professional. Not lots. I don't want to say a lot. But I have had multiple instances where I've gotten messages from people that were purely inappropriate for a networking platform and a professional network. And so how do we like their code of conduct doesn't seem to be, at least I haven't seen it happen, where they're very actively trying to get people off of the site who are abusing the terms and services. Have you run into those types of situations? Absolutely. Especially on especially the more that I post on LinkedIn. People get real weird, real fast. I'm really good at blocking people on LinkedIn. I'm really good at ignoring people's messages on LinkedIn. I have to because because of the position I'm in like running an agency, I am constantly receiving messages from people promoting their app. Like, let's partner or I would like you to outsource work to me, I get that one a lot.

**Kelly**  5:08  
Yeah. And I just I can't I can't keep up with it. And I've had people even tell me that it's rude to ignore them. I'm like, if I spent all my time responding to all these outsourcing requests that I get, I would literally have to outsource work to them because I wouldn't get anything done. Yeah, plus

**Emma**  5:24  
this just spam. I was that rude to ignore them. I mean, we're not ignoring them. We're prioritizing and they're things over. I think there's a difference. It's not like I'm actively reading your message being like, I'm actually like, no, this is terrible. I'm not going to respond to you. It's just like, we need to prioritize our Yeah, we can respond to what we can't. I also find us kind of spammy. I've noticed like if you update anything on your profile, regarding a job, like we had just added the ladybug podcast to LinkedIn and Kelly mmediately got like 15 and congrats on the new job. And it's like, I hate those auto responses that make it super easy for people to just say Bam, you essentially especially once you get into like, hundreds and thousands of LinkedIn connections that becomes really overwhelming and that's I simply just don't use it much anymore. Yeah.

**Ali**  6:08  
I also think that the quality of posts on LinkedIn for me personally, I don't enjoy it. I feel like they are very self promotional for the most part. Yeah. And we call them bro a tree. There was this BuzzFeed article about bro a tree on LinkedIn. It's this very formulaic model that a lot of people follow for their LinkedIn posts of these like melodramatic stories and how they overcame what they overcame. And it's just like, oh my goodness, like, please just post something that's not about you for once it feels self centered to me. And so I tend to stay off LinkedIn, I check my messages sometimes and connect with my former students. But LinkedIn is not my place,

**Emma**  6:55  
though. To be perfectly honest, I steer away From those types of sites for any type of meaningful networking, simply because I don't feel like it's a way to establish a meaningful connection to someone. So for me personally, the best connections I've made with people are just by getting to know them on a human level, not inappropriately not like crossing boundaries in terms of me, you know, saying too much about myself from a personal perspective, but just forming that connection with someone like, Oh, I see you work in Stockholm. Like, let's take the example of how I got my job, right? This engineering managers just reached out he said, Hey, I have a job you might be interested in, and then we just kept, we kept talking. And I wasn't ready to move to Stockholm at that point. It was a year, a year ago, actually, and I pulled out of the interview process, but you know, we kept a nice conversation like I got to know Sean, on like, a, like a shallow personal level. That sounds bad. It's not like we're best friends, but we get to get to know each other's people. And then when the time came back around where I was ready to reach out to him, that was a network I was able to tap into. And so for me, I don't think the superficial, professional posts, the self promotional posts are the way to go, in my opinion based on my experiences. For me, I like to actually just get to know people through their work. For example, if you post blogs, or through your YouTube channel or things like that, where I can get to know you as a person, I'm more apt to help you if I know you as a person and value you as a human, then through these promotions.

**Kelly**  8:23  
And I

**Ali**  8:24  
will also say that a lot of these problems are problems in person, two of the people at meetups who hit on you instead of asking your technical opinion or talking about technical things, like that's very much a thing, especially after you speak. And then it's also kind of a thing that some people are only focused on themselves and promotion. There's a meetup in DC that I went to once and it was all people who were just talking about their thing that they were pitching, as are their early stage startup, and it was just exhausting. And so I never went back So I think depending on the social search situation, this is something that can happen in person too. It's just exacerbated online.

**Emma**  9:07  
I think, part of the in person anxiety, I have a networking because I do get very socially anxious. So I'm an introvert in a sense, I come across as very outgoing. But for me talking with people drains, my energy, it depletes it. I don't gain energy from speaking with people. And so networking is really difficult for me. It's something I actively have to choose to do. But why am I there are really two reasons I'm afraid of networking. And the first being Yeah, as a woman, I do get hit on in professional settings. And I don't appreciate that. We want to feel safe in a safe space where we can simply just talk about work or about our technical skills. But the second is this imbalance of a relationship. So when I network with someone, I want a symbiotic relationship, we both should be getting something out of this not transaction, but out of this relationship, essentially. But a lot of times I don't know about you both. But I've had people who all they want something from me. Yeah, yeah. And that's so one sided. And that's something else I'm scared of, especially once you start gaining a following on the internet, and this goes for people in your life, but it also goes for the company you work for, and all those kind of things. Once you start gaining a following people look at you differently, they treat you differently, they all of a sudden want to be your quote unquote, friend, because they reap the benefits of your network when they do so. And this is really difficult.

**Ali**  10:26  
Yeah, and there are people that I'm willing to lend that to you like my former students, and there are people that I really care about and for the most part would vouch for in a professional setting because I worked with them in a professional setting, but then there are people who call dm you on Twitter, like, promote my thing for me, and they don't even say please, or anything like that. It's just promote my thing. And it's like, and they don't even, they don't even Yeah, exactly. They don't even call you and it's like, Um, no, that's not how that works. You know, that a huge amount of value to me, and it's gonna annoy my father. to spam them with something. So yeah, it's disappointing is kind of one of those things that's a hard side of humanity that you see when you get a bigger following. I

**Kelly**  11:10  
do want to talk about some of the positives that can come out of networking as well. Yes, we're getting super negative here. So, you know, why is networking important? Like why? Why is it beneficial? First off, you can develop and improve your skill set things like meetups and conferences, speaking at the conferences, listening to other conference talks, or meetup talks, you can learn a lot when you're networking and just talking to other people in various industries. You can stay on top of whatever is happening in the industry as well. You can keep a pulse on the job market. You know, like Emma said, networking, that's that's what led her to her new job. And same with Allie. That's what you know, following her, her previous co workers to new positions as well. You can meet your prospective mentors or your next boss once again, especially at a meet up you know, just talking to somebody in who you know, maybe They work for Google. And they're like, oh, here's all my really cool experience working for Google, or here's my really honest experience working for the company I'm currently working for. And I honestly don't really like it. So, you know, it's these kinds of conversations that can come from networking that are really, really beneficial.

**Emma**  12:15  
Definitely, I think to you know, the point of using networking to develop your career. When we said career, I want to be very clear, this is not just your nine to five job. If you have a nine to five job Yes, it's your primary source of income in general. It's what you would consider yourself. Like when people ask me Oh, what do you do I say, Oh, I'm a software engineer at LogMeIn, that's my my primary job but your career encompasses so much more than that. It can be if you develop courses externally for other like for egghead or for front end masters or if you blog, or if you create a podcast like these are a part of your career. So don't box yourself into this idea that just developing your career has to do with your nine to five job it can also do with all these different side projects like I've been very vocal about the fact that I'm paying off a ton of medical debt at the moment. And I have an absurd amount of side projects that have come as a result of networking. You know, I've got to create these courses with LinkedIn in front of masters, and work with Stack Overflow, and just all these really, really cool things because of my networking, and my personal brand online. So these are things that you can absolutely do as well.

**Ali**  13:22  
Yeah, for sure. And I think another one that we may have missed is that you can make friends with similar interests to you to having you all as friends is great because we all are software engineers, and all in the same field. And that's something that you can do through networking is find other people who have similar interest to you and so many of my friends work in this industry and so that's nice to have to even outside of a professional escalation or anything like that.

**Emma**  13:53  
I completely agree. It's funny cuz we started this podcast before we were even really friends with each other like we were friendly. But I wouldn't say we were like best friends. And then you know what? Over a year later, or nothing? rude. But no, Sally's point. Yeah, if you are struggling. So let's say you are not in a work culture where there are people who look like you or come from a similar background as you like, I'm not currently in a place where there are a ton of female engineers at the moment. Well, I can go network with people digitally, and make friends with people like me, or even better, who are unlike me, right? Because we don't want to surround ourselves with just the same cookie cutter version of ourselves. We want to actually challenge ourselves to find a diverse network, surround yourself with people who are different than you, because they challenge you and they teach you the hard lessons in life that you otherwise would not get to experience. So that's just something I wanted to say. But I think this kind of leads us into this idea of what about people listening who don't have the privilege of getting out of the house to network people with kids, people taking care of sicker elderly family members, people without the money to go attend conferences, or live in rural areas. How can we like what kinds of tips can we give those people to network where they don't miss out, they still reap all the benefits they can do. So with the time that they have and the amount of energy they have to dedicate to it.

**Kelly**  15:21  
I think it all goes back to digital networking. You don't have to do face to face networking. And I think it's also important to note that you don't have like networking is not a requirement for job success. So if it is something you just flat out don't like doing. Or it's something that you know, you're unable to do for any given reason. It's not going to prevent you from having an incredible career.

**Ali**  15:47  
Yeah, or networking during your work day to have making solid connections with colleagues, with people that you maybe don't always talk to people off of your team maybe going to event internally at your company. doesn't take any time away from anything but your workday really. You don't need to spend additional time away from your family or anything like that to do that. So I think that that's a really good idea as well. And also, I will say as far as the rural thing goes, I grew up super, super, super, super, super rural. And when I was in New Hampshire visiting my parents, I actually learned that there are JavaScript meetups multiple within a relatively quick radius of there. So you'll be surprised even if you do live in a rural area and think that there's definitely no developer meetups here you still check because there might be a couple in a small size city near you. You can

**Kelly**  16:43  
even start like an impromptu meetup on your own, you know, and that's one thing that's important, like if you if there's nothing around you, but you want to start something, you don't have to do like a formal production here in order to have like a conference, you know, you can literally just be let's get together and have a drink. Discuss JavaScript. You know, it doesn't have to be anything super formal.

**Emma**  17:03  
Oh, I was just gonna mention what we do for our meetup because I help organize a Karlsruhe jazz meetup here, what we do is we reach out to local businesses or people that we reach our network and reach out to people who are JavaScript developers and say, Hey, would your company be interested in sponsoring one of our events, all we need to do is order pizza or order some kind of intermission food and that's it, you can plug your company if you have any openings and things like that. And people are absolutely willing to do that. So if you are looking to start something local, reach out to these businesses, you know, go to your local coffee shops and say, Hey, like, would you be willing to provide us some food or at least a discount? And we will advertise you actively?

**Kelly**  17:43  
And I think we discussed some, some specifics of how we can network you know, you can use Twitter, you can use LinkedIn, attend conferences or meetups, just a couple others. I've met people at coffee shops, like unintentionally, it wasn't an arranged meetup. We just happen to be sitting at the same community table. When we got to talking, and now we're connected on LinkedIn, and we can continue the conversation. So you know, impromptu, you know, conversations you have with random strangers, I talk to strangers, my mom would be very disappointed in me. The last one I would have mentioned is slack organizations. So there is a slack app called donut that automatically assigns you a some other person in the slack org each week. And it just introduces the two of you so you can have a conversation and get to know each other. The Shopify partners slack group does this. And I think it's I think it's super cool.

**Ali**  18:35  
That's awesome. That's a huge one. Even most meetup groups have a slack group associated with them. So if you're in DC, for example, there's the DC tech slack. There's the Women Who Code DC slack. And even if you don't go to any of the meetups, those slack organizations are also just so valuable to be in they have jobs channels, they have channels where you can ask him answer technical questions, and you can just make friend and direct message people have a direct line to communicate with them. So I think that that's a really, really great one to mention as well.

**Emma**  19:08  
I think it's also important just to say like, as much as I admire Kelly, his ability to talk to a fence post, I, I, it sounds mean, I didn't mean it. I mean, why I'm just socially awkward. Um, I struggle to talk to new people, like some days, I'm really outgoing, and we'll just spin up a conversation with someone. But in all honesty, a lot of times I avoid eye contact, I avoid talking to other people because I have a lot of social anxiety. And so if that's you, that's okay. Like you can still network and that's why I think digital networking is such a benefit to introverts and other people with social anxiety because you can network on your own terms. If you're uncomfortable in a like a conversation, you can leave versus in person, it's a lot more difficult to do that. So if you're struggling with those types of anxieties like I am, I would highly recommend digital networking. We did actually do An episode about building your brand. I can't remember what it was called. But we discussed all these things that we do online, whether it's through our Twitter, whether it's through our portfolios or blogs or whatever, and to build our brand and that's also a really great way to network because people will see the work that you're doing and your mission statement essentially and they will reach out to you actively if they if they agree or if they want to be part of it. So if you are putting yourself out there people generally will come find you.

**Kelly**  20:28  
Absolutely. is called personal branding.

Unknown Speaker  20:33  
Very original.

**Emma**  20:36  
I like how one of our first episodes we had like a really great title, like how the ladybugs got their spots and then we were like, okay, we're gonna keep doing cute titles and now it's just like networking, personal branding.

**Kelly**  20:47  
super lazy with it, but that's okay. Because the content is what we're there for,

**Emma**  20:51  
for show for show. Should we talk about some tips for networking? Yeah.

**Kelly**  20:55  
First of all, I want to bring up At a good example when it comes to nurturing your relationships. So there's this Forbes article written by Tom Farley, the former president of the New York Stock Exchange, about how every every connection like every job he's ever gotten, he can attribute back to networking. And he talks about nurturing relationships and how important it is specifically with talking to Jeff sprecher, who is the CEO of the Intercontinental exchange, who owns the New York Stock Exchange. It was like seven years before ice had bought the New York Board of Trade, New York Stock Exchange, and he like the two of them met and there was absolutely no reason for them to actually be talking. Like there's no job opportunity or anything, but he just like kept on emailing Jeff and having phone calls with Jeff and kept up that relationship. And then five years later, he like I spot the New York Board of Trade. And then two years later, after that, he was asked to be the president of New York stock exchange. That's a pretty big deal.

**Emma**  22:02  
That's wild. Yeah, I mean, think about it. And like this whole, like that seems so unachievable to just anyone listening to this. But I think this I don't want this to sound conceited because I don't mean it this way. But if you take a look at my, the timeline of how I built my network, especially on Twitter, I just had 100,000 followers and a year and four months ago, I had 200. And I spent an absurd amount of time blogging and being on the internet. I think I spent like six hours a day doing it was a full time job. But you can do it. I will say two things. One, it takes a lot of work to do it. And two, it does typically take a lot longer than it took me However, if you are really invested in growing your network, go for it. You can absolutely do it. I have a blog post called I think it's called how I gained 65,000 followers in like a year. I think that's what I call that we'll link it in the show notes. That kind of breaks down my analytics and give some tips into how I think what I think I did that made an actual difference. But yeah, again, some of that is due to the fact of, you know, the fact that I am a woman or whatever like some of it is circumstantial. But that being said, with producing content consistently and with being very actively with being very actively engaged with engaging people actively, my English is totally deteriorating, the more countries I move to, the more active you are with people responding liking their responses, you're definitely gonna get more engagement, you're definitely going to be able to expand your network and hopefully get job interviews if that's something you're looking for.

**Kelly**  23:42  
Absolutely. And I think there are also a couple other posts on on to about networking on Twitter, and building an audience on Twitter as well. But that's a whole personal brand episode.

**Emma**  23:54  
So if you're planning to expand your network, one tip I have is to be easy to connect with Contact. So like claim all of the domains claim the Twitter handle have all the same handles on on social media, it's going to help you so your LinkedIn extension, if you match that with your Twitter handle and your Instagram handle or whatever else you use for professional networking, that's going to be really, really great. I also what's something I've started doing is taking all my social media sites, ones that I had previously use just for personal things like Facebook. I'm not turning those into more professional networking sites like Instagram. It's really hard to separate work and personal life once you start gaining some following. People still want to actively friend you on Facebook, they want to follow you on Instagram. So for me, I've kind of decided to turn those into more business profiles. But yeah, claiming the same handle on all sites makes your SEO better and makes it easier to give someone your contact information if you can just give them one handle and it propagates to all the different sites. So that's one of the tips that I have. I'm pretty sure all of my handles are different.

**Kelly**  24:58  
Instagram is taproom Kelly Twitter is kV Li, LinkedIn is Kelly Vaughn. Facebook is My name is Kelly. Every single one is different. I just realized this. That's so funny. Well, that's why you don't have any follow Oh, okay, maybe I'll just change my Twitter handle. No, I'm not I'm never changing it I'm gonna be cavelli forever. Evaluate

**Ali**  25:20  
my Instagram is different because originally my personal private Instagram was my handle that I use on public social media, but I changed that because I didn't want people following me on my personal Instagram, so maybe I can change my professional one right now I'm gonna check this is making me think

**Kelly**  25:39  
while alius checking that's another good tip is to do your homework. If there are specific people that you're interested in reaching out to maybe they work for a certain company you want to work for or you're interested in their career path, do your homework on them, like find out, you know, their previous, you know, some of the things that they've done some of the things that they're interested in and not a stocking Wait I'm really distracted by Ms cat right now.

**Emma**  26:05  
So we I feel like we should post a picture on our website of our zoom chat because every every time we record my cat there's just like a little

Unknown Speaker  26:13  
she'll,

**Emma**  26:15  
in any case anyway, if you've got pets love the moral of the story alley what tip do you have for

**Ali**  26:23  
yeah I think along with do your homework is do your homework before reaching out to somebody to. So if you are reaching out to somebody with a junior Java job in Little Rock, Arkansas, maybe don't respond or don't cold reach out to a senior software engineer in New York City. You just might have better luck if you like tailor who you're reaching out to. I think we see that a lot with the recruiters were it's a number game. But I also see it with people trying to network on Twitter where they're like Will you be my mentor? Or will you be my mentor, I want to learn how to do Java, which I don't do Java. tons of things like that, where it's clearly not tailored. And it makes me just not want to read really any messages period to be to be blunt, and that sounds awful. But it's just kind of exhausting. And it's like, okay, nobody's actually putting any effort in. It's just a numbers game. So I do try to respond to people who really personalize their message, but not even the best at that to be honest. But make sure that you're doing your homework on who you're reaching out to and not reaching out to people with completely opposite backgrounds and what you're looking for.

Unknown Speaker  27:42  
I completely agree. I think too.

**Emma**  27:45  
It's really important to be mindful of everyone's time and be respectful of everyone's time. So if you're planning to ask someone for something, a either offer them something in return that potentially will benefit them and be come to them with a list of action. items that you want to accomplish during meeting with them or something like if you're planning to schedule like a meeting with them, try to keep it as short as possible 30 start with 30 minutes. And if you need more added 15 minute or 10 minute increments, like don't just book an hour of their time, but also send them an agenda ahead of time, like have things that you need to cover. So you're making the most out of all of your time, for sure.

**Kelly**  28:22  
I'd also recommend reaching outside of your network. So you don't have to network with people only in software engineering, for example, you can network with people in any field whatsoever, you never know who it is that they know, you never know. You know, maybe they happen to be some like interested in making a career switch or maybe you just both like playing. I don't know, baseball, and fortnight or playing fortnight. There we go. That's more relevant. Nobody's playing baseball right now. Um, and you know, it just it's a good opportunity to get different opinions from sticking inside the silo that is your career, your life. You're in interests,

**Ali**  29:00  
one that I really like is to find a buddy to go to events with, especially as a woman, it can be kind of intimidating to go to these networking events and there are some people who are very creepy at them. Those people are the outliers. I will say that but it definitely is something that happens and so if you feel like that might be something that might happen to you having somebody to go to events with makes it so much better. And then you can have some sort of signal like, get me out of this conversation. Come see me I do that with my friends. I don't want to be talking about this. Anyways, thinking about a really gross we have conversation that some dude have with me. But it also just makes it more comfortable to like you know that you have somebody to talk to you're not just going to be an island, you're not going to be this person who's standing by yourself the whole entire time. You're gonna have at least somebody to network with For me, that makes it so much easier to meet more people if I have somebody who I feel comfortable with that I can at least start the conversation with

**Emma**  30:08  
this is what I do at parties I don't go to parties well I don't go to parties full stop. But if I do I always bring a network Yeah.

**Ali**  30:16  
Oh, totally agree. Like have to at least have one very close friend there or else it's not not worth it.

**Emma**  30:22  
Or like a mega stage for clinger?

**Ali**  30:25  
Yeah, oral make sure that tebah friend like get ready or pregame beforehand so then we can go together.

**Emma**  30:31  
I love it. Anyway.

Unknown Speaker  30:36  
Um,

**Emma**  30:36  
so after you actually do network with people, what what what next? Kelly? What would you recommend after networking with someone,

**Kelly**  30:45  
follow up with them. continue having a conversation to have their name on your best day remember people's names is I my arm is just like tattoos of people. And then I just get like the the white tattoos after that and then the black tattoos over there. And then Now my arm is just an arm. Yeah, I'm very I'm, I lost my train of thought there. No, I mean, it's really important to continue following up with the people you meet when you when you're going to a meet up because you're probably meeting a fair number of people they're probably meeting a fair number of people. We're not necessarily in an age where we're all sharing business cards anymore. There are definitely still people who have business cards, but I think there's a an eco friendly component to it, where people are starting to go digital with their information, you know, sharing social media accounts really is a it's an easy way to network. You know, just following up afterwards, like the next day is saying like, hey, it was really great to meet you. I really enjoyed talking to you. And then if you have any anything of interest that you want to ask them afterwards, like that's when you can, you know, schedule another meeting with them to continue the conversation. Any other tips that y'all have for networking, don't be afraid to step outside your comfort zone. And this can very much mean that you want to network with somebody who is the CEO of a company or like higher up. You can form some really great, you know, relationships with people who maybe have, you know, a C suite job or VP level job, who you can learn a lot from, and they can learn a lot from you. The worst that people are going to say, is either No, or say absolutely nothing, and just ignore you. So maybe it could take like a small hit to your ego if you don't hear back from them. But there are a lot of really nice people out there who are more than happy to share what they know.

**Ali**  32:44  
Yeah, and even if they don't respond, it's probably not personal. It's probably just that they get overloaded.

**Kelly**  32:50  
Unless it's Emma who's reaching out. Then it's personal. Yeah.

**Emma**  32:56  
Gross. I don't even know we're talking about anymore. Yeah. I definitely think this. And this is kind of a tangent. But we talked about this in our episode with Kim mica, about this hero worship kind of thing where like you see people in the industry that you look up to, maybe you want to network with them, but you see them as being like a different level than you. And I think we forget the end of the end of the day Rodas people. Yeah, to Kelly's point, some people might not have the bandwidth to be able to respond to you. But you have nothing to lose, but putting yourself out there if you're respectful of their time, but also with the language that you use and all of those kinds of things. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain just, yeah, be respectful, choose professional language. Don't send them 15 follow up messages if they don't respond with question marks. At the end of the day, like just go for it. And if they respond, awesome, and if they don't, you've lost nothing.

**Kelly**  33:53  
Awesome. Any any final tips before we close out?

**Emma**  33:56  
I mean, I'm a little sad. We didn't get to talk about actual network. I was really looking forward to talking about buses. We should do like a guest

**Ali**  34:03  
episode on computer networking because I know nothing about it. But Julia Evans, like she goes by Bork online, she has some really, really great like zooms on it, which are fascinating, but I still don't fully understand. So that would be a cool episode.

**Kelly**  34:20  
I agree. I think it's it. I know, like my husband took the CC and T CCNA certifications. And so I've watched him study for, you know, the networking exams or certifications or whatever. At one point, we had this giant thing in our house. I had like routers and switches connected to it. And I'm totally going to be butchering whatever is what but all I know is that it was huge. And it was really noisy. It is no longer in our house anymore. I think he sold it to somebody else who was wanting to study for the networking exams. But I think it'd be super interesting to learn more about it because I think there's a lot of things that cross over into the software engineering land that you We could definitely benefit from.

**Emma**  35:01  
Yeah, just looking Julia has a ton of really great what she calls wizard ziens. We'll link it in the show notes. There's one on HTTP, which is something I struggled with to understand like network request and all that. But she does have a bite sized one on networking. It definitely. Oh my god, there's a pizza on the cover.

**Kelly**  35:21  
Yeah. Awesome. All right. Do you want to transition to shout outs? Okay, Emma, what's a shout out?

**Emma**  35:29  
Um, I just want to give a huge shout out to anyone who took the time out of their lives to review my book. So Kent C, Dodds wrote me a wonderful review as the next door neighbor, Laura gift was also she gave me some really great feedback. And she goon as well, who created shocker UI has given me some amazing pointers as well. So to those four, and anyone else who's reviewed my book, thank you so much.

**Ali**  35:56  
I appreciate it. How are you Allie? Awesome. I promise I will get around. to it, by the time that this episode comes out, it's on my to do list.

**Kelly**  36:04  
I think this is this is Episode Four of the new season. So that means that you have approximately four weeks to do it.

**Ali**  36:12  
Yes, that's a good amount of time. Mine is for Laura Hogan's book resilient management. I've decided that I want to pursue engineering management as the next phase in my career and kind of the medium term future. I really like seeing people grow and working with people, to me is more rewarding than working with computers at this point. And this book is incredible. It has so much actionable advice and so many boiler plates for conversations with people and I think it's just incredible. It's really quick. You can move through it super fast and I'm just really, really enjoying it. So highly recommend.

**Kelly**  36:49  
Awesome. I'm going to jump off of alleys as well and recommend another management book that I've been reading called radical candor. I keep on quoting it in various places. And I've been really enjoying it. It's a pretty easy read. The concepts are, are easy to understand. I think I just struggle with getting through any kind of management book because I'm like, Oh, I need to apply this thing right now. And then he stopped reading, and then I pick it up four days later. I'm like, Oh, I am on page four. But that's okay. I'll eventually get the book, and it'll be a good time. So let's close this out.
