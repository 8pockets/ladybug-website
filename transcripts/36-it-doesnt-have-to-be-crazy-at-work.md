How often have you found yourself working late into the night at the office? Or maybe taking advantage of the quote unquote benefits like free dinner, only to realize that your work life balance is strained? If this sounds like you, chances are it might be crazy at work. For this month's Ladybug podcast book club. We read it doesn't have to be crazy at work by Jason freed and David Heine. Mr. Hansen best noticed DHH in it, they share their experience about maintaining a healthy work life balance and how they've implemented these measures at their company. Basecamp let's jump in.

Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly.

**Emma**  0:35  
I'm Allie. And I'm Emma and we're debugging the tech industry.

**Kelly**  0:40  
Okay, so let's just start about talking about Basecamp. So we like for my company, we use Basecamp as our project management system. But before I get into it, I want to hear about from YouTube about what your experience is with Basecamp what you know about it?

**Emma**  0:53  
Nothing. Yes, I literally know nothing we use, we use JIRA which is freaking nightmare. For our Project Management and I would much prefer to use Basecamp. I think they have a free version for solopreneurs. Right?

**Kelly**  1:07  
They do. Yes. Which is the coolest thing I did not exist when I needed it as a when I was just starting out. So Basecamp it is a project management system. It's like an all in one kind of system where you can add your like individual products or projects, whether you're working internally for the different teams, or in my case, as an agency. Each project is a different client project. You can add whichever of your team members to a given project, you have an area called the campfire that gives you an option is like a like a chat, basically, oh, there are no marshmallows, there's no marshmallows. There's a message board. You can again tag people you can add gifts if you need to, which is always important. There's a to do section there's a document section so you can you know, upload things directly into Basecamp and link like Google Drive docs which is super useful and is also a calendar sections you can schedule out the to dues, you can schedule out specific events, including end dates. And it gives you like a high level overview of what everybody is working on and what you know when things are due. I love it. I can keep track of what my what my team is working on. And also I can see how the clients are responding if they're responding and I can follow up with them if need be. Really big fan of Basecamp. I've been using it for several several years. And one of my favorite things about Basecamp is that they lock you into your pricing for whatever it was when you signed up. They never increase your pricing. So I think it's currently like 99 a month for a paid plan. I'm still paying 29 a month while your grandmother died in him grandmother in also cool. one of the cofounders of Basecamp DHH is also the founder of Ruby on Rails. We

**Emma**  2:51  
have no experience with Ruby and Ruby on a lot of Ruby on Rails.

**Kelly**  2:55  
That's something you know a little bit about

**Emma**  2:59  
just another thing to mention Is that Jason and DHH? Well, I don't know if Jason was part of it, but DHH was definitely on it with another male. And they were discussing remote work tips on a live stream on Twitter. I think they were just talking about what's going on in the world with the pandemic, but they were discussing remote work and how I think they were talking about how some companies have even handled the situation because this is unprecedented. So if you're interested in listening to those, I don't know if Twitter saves live streams. But

**Kelly**  3:30  
I think there are a stream like on Twitch though, so I think you can really, yeah, I think you can go back and watch them. And Jason was involved in those. Also one of the things that I've been loving that DHH has been doing so he's a very outspoken man. And he lets everybody know what his opinion is. He's been calling out the companies that could theoretically be working from home, but they're still making their employees go into the Yes, that

**Emma**  3:53  
was an amazing thread. Yeah. Then he switched gears into like praise companies who are allowing remote workers I thought was a nice twist on it too.

**Ali**  4:02  
I agree they've been doing a lot of really great things with the whole pandemic, with allow or giving everybody time off, even though they were already remote to start out with, but it's just cool watching them, they have a very set moral code and you can tell that through a lot of their actions. So I like watching that.

**Kelly**  4:25  
I also just want to plug a couple more books from from the cofounders of Basecamp remote office not required, I think it's called is one of their books right now. Obviously super relevant given the fact that we are currently dealing with the corona virus and also shape up as another book that's been on my list to read. I think it's basically just like how they handle product development at Basecamp. Through their cycles, which we will be talking a little bit since it was touched on it doesn't have to be crazy at work as well.

**Ali**  4:59  
Cool. So,

**Kelly**  5:01  
one of the things that is very well known about Basecamp is they publish their, their company Handbook, which includes how they run their company, all the benefits that they give their employees exactly how they handle certain situations. So if you wanted to, you know, replicate anything for your own company, you can do that. So, one of the sections was talking about their benefits. So, to the two of you, what are your preferred benefits? Like what what would you prefer to get from a company because obviously free dinners not

**Unknown Speaker**  5:33  
great, I've had that I'm

**Ali**  5:36  
not even gonna lie like totally worked at companies that have both free lunch and free dinner, which just means that you're working

**Kelly**  5:44  
okay with free lunch to a level like I like Friday free lunches or something like not everyday free lunch because that that obviously hinders you from giving yourself a reason to leave the office. That's totally

**Ali**  5:56  
what it is, is that they try to keep you

**Emma**  5:59  
at your desk. We have every Wednesday is breakfast day, free breakfast day. And then every once a month, every Thursday is community lunch where we all get together, but then they also do like happy hours once a month as well, like Thirsty Thursday. I think that's a great benefit because it's not forcing it upon like, you're not making people feel guilty for coming and going whenever they need to. What what other benefits do I think I think having flexible work life balance is important, especially given for me like, my family is only us. I live in Europe, the time difference is six hours generally. And so sometimes I need to I don't know get on FaceTime with my mom or something in a certain time that's during the workday. So like having flexibility to work from home or do personal errands during the day and then make up the hours you know, later is super important for me.

**Ali**  6:51  
Yeah, for me. I would agree with that. We have a lot of social events at ga both for employees and for students, and I really do enjoy that. But I think the lunch every day and dinner every day, that one gets to be a lot. And it's just an excuse to give you at your desk. But I would agree with Emma that having flexible time is important and time off. Like, one of my favorite things about my current position is that I have 30 days of PTO a year. And having that set number for me is so helpful. Having the unlimited totally stresses me out. And so I will never take vacation time. So that's really, really nice for me and a huge amount of time off. So I'm really, really privileged to have that. I in the past, I've also negotiated different work hours, so I'm kind of a morning person. So I'd normally negotiate working like seven to three instead of nine to five. And that's been really big for me as well. But I think another thing that I would think about in the future is a movie for the days a week working instead of

**Emma**  7:57  
five

**Kelly**  7:58  
and then something that Basecamp does And it's summertime.

**Emma**  8:02  
Yeah, really quick though before we talk about base camp, I just thought of a couple other things that were really important to me that I forgot about. The first being conferences and the ability to continue learning. When I first joined LogMeIn, they paid for me to take German classes wasn't required. I wanted to do it was very expensive. It was through link OTA, which is something I would recommend highly. It's the only service that has worked for me to learn another language. We'll link that in the show notes, but it was expensive. It was like 500 euro for six months, and they paid for that. And then additionally, every person was allowed to go to one conference a year and they'll pay for the travel, the food, all of that stuff. They sent a couple of our designers over to San Francisco for the awards conference, which it's a it's an expensive plane ticket, but they did it and they bought the conference ticket and all that stuff. So that's important. And then the second thing was hardware, being able to pick my own computer setup. If I wanted a Mac or a PC or how many monitors I wanted things like that. That was it. Something I forgot about,

**Kelly**  9:00  
I think it's also important to note that the type of benefits that you're going to get, obviously, it's going to depend on the size of the company or for joining. I, for example, don't have a huge, huge budget to put towards a really flashy benefits, but I try to take as good care of my employees as possible. I started doing 1500 dollars towards whether like computer equipment like hardware or something you need for the office or whatever it might be. I haven't figured out that's going to be like an annual thing or just a one time thing, because it's the first time I'm offering it,

**Emma**  9:30  
do you think it's worth it to have personalized benefits? Like Was that something that you would have in a conversation with your employees be like, what is important to you? Is it office equipment? Or is it you know, leaving early on Fridays during summer or?

**Kelly**  9:44  
Yeah, I mean, I think it's worth having that conversation, but the larger your company becomes, the harder that becomes to manage. So it's something that you definitely have to keep in mind. I try to be flexible with the working time, especially at times like this, when people have their family and kids at home that you know, things come up. So if you need to shift your work hours is something I completely understand. I do expect, you know, I would I would prefer you have a presence five days a week because we do have questions that come up. And if you're the primary developer on a project, I would like to you to be available to answer questions. I so one of the benefits I give is, of course, being in the shop by spaces, tickets to shop by unite. However, there's a cap on how many tickets you can buy a per team. So I don't like for now I can still send my employees to Shopify unite with me. But once I heard my next employee, I'm now going to be capped at the number of tickets I can buy and so I can no longer buy it for every single employee. So I haven't figured out how I'm going to manage that one. Like who gets to go.

**Emma**  10:50  
Also, maybe some people don't want to go some people don't like to travel.

**Kelly**  10:53  
Exactly. Yeah. So that could be a possibility and make my life a whole lot easier. I'm also So paying for my project manager to get her a PMP certification, because that is really helpful for project managers to enter don't have that certification in general, especially like if she wants to pursue a career elsewhere in the future like that certification is going to be really, really valuable for her. And yes, I'm talking about her leaving the company, but for now it's making my life easier with her being at my company and being better trained. So there's middle look at it. Yeah. Because,

**Emma**  11:32  
like IBM, the way they used to my dad went through this program where they hired him when he and they paid for his master's degree at RPI. And he went to school, I believe he went full time. So he was still getting paid a portion of a salary. He they were paying for all of his coursework. He was a full time student, but then in return, I think he had to stay like three years or something. But they don't do that anymore. And there's not as much of an investment on higher education from companies. But that's Yeah, I'd be thoroughly interested in

**Kelly**  12:00  
I agree. It's really expensive.

**Ali**  12:02  
It's interesting. Some companies do, especially as part of severance packages I've seen I'm seeing it a lot with ga is that a lot of companies are putting get putting their students through ga as part of their severance packages, which is fascinating. Interesting. Yeah. I've had quite a few students recently who have had that situation. So

**Emma**  12:26  
I think the point is, though, like everyone's desired benefits are going to be done. Yeah, for me, like, my priorities right now are on making the amount of money that's appropriate to the skills that I bring to the table. I wouldn't say that I have always been in a position like I'm fine financially. But like, for me, I don't feel like I'm necessarily being compensated fully for all of the different hats I'm expected to wear. And that's really a deficit for me because I'm at a point where I'm on a massive debt payoff journey. And so my priority is in terms of benefits for right now. Bonus and the ability to get a promotion in a reasonable time versus like ask me again in five years. And my benefits will probably be like, more geared towards work life balance or the ability to mentor people or whatever. But I do think people's desire benefits evolve over time.

**Kelly**  13:16  
Yeah, that's absolutely true. And, unfortunately, for a lot of companies that ends up that you have to leave the company and find a different position, if you're going to find the benefits that you want, they are not going to be flexible with that. So kind of talking about the benefits that Basecamp in particular offers or it's pretty cool because their benefits aim to get the employees out of the office and not actually stay in the office.

**Emma**  13:38  
My favorite part of that chapter was like, so many companies emphasize these benefits that really just subconsciously encourage employees to stay in the office versus now Basecamp is flipping that on its head and Kelly's gonna read us some of the benefits and we can discuss them, but there's one in particular I was excited to read.

**Kelly**  13:55  
Do you want to read that one first?

**Emma**  13:57  
That was a weird place to end that sentence. Yeah. So my favorite was the thousand dollars a year for continued education. But it doesn't have to be job related. It can be used for cooking classes, it could be used if you wanted to learn guitar. I love that because there are so many things I want to do in my spare time that I simply can't afford because they're not cheap. Like I would love to go back and take German classes or I would love to go get my master's degree. You know, Arizona State University has a great thing. It's like $6,000 for the entire diploma or $12,000. Like those are generally affordable for a large company. And the return on investment would be good, but the fact that they're providing this benefit and it doesn't have to be work related is super cool.

**Kelly**  14:38  
Yeah, I think I think that's really cool. And I think it brings the human factor back to each employee as well. Because we are all we are all different people. We all have different goals.

**Unknown Speaker**  14:48  
So

**Kelly**  14:49  
they offer fully paid vacations every year. Now this is not like paid vacation time. They're literally paying for your vacation up to $5,000 per person or a family.

**Unknown Speaker**  14:59  
Unreal. That's so Cool,

**Kelly**  15:00  
I don't know how it calculates out. But that is that is so cool

**Emma**  15:04  
for me though. Like, that would freak me out like I don't know, I'm not the kind of person like I get very anxiety ridden if thinking about like, oh my gosh do people think I'm taking advantage of the company? Blah blah blah like if it's a benefit they offer like that's great but for me I don't know if that's I feel comfortable with that I don't know I just it's it feels to me like it's I'm taking advantage of them which is so backwards in the fact that even think that way is kind of messed up but I don't know

**Kelly**  15:31  
but I mean that's that's the world we live in. That's that's like that's exactly the problem with it. Yeah. And I think that's a it has a lot to do with the company culture in itself is like framing these kinds of benefits like a 30 day paid sabbatical every three every three years like that's a really long time off for Americans like we're not used to seeing that in like framing it in a way that this is not like you're not taking advantage of us like we are giving this to you as a Thank you for all the hard work that you've been putting in with the company over time. And that's a very important thing to start from the leadership level to instill this kind of message in all the employees. One of my favorite things that they do is during the summer months, they have Friday's off every single Friday, you're off. So you're working four day workweeks in the summer. I love that that's and so not Yeah. And it's not that they're working 40 days or 40 hours a week. In four days, they're literally working 32 hours a week. No, they just adjust their project timelines. They adjust their project, I put expectations to have that one less day working per week.

**Emma**  16:39  
That's nice. We have some more hours in the office. It's like you can distribute your remaining hours through like monday through thursday and leave early on Friday, but it's just not the same. Like I don't want to work late for four days and then leave early on

**Kelly**  16:52  
Friday. I don't know exactly. It's still overworking those other days, and then you're you're spending you're spending your entire one extra Your day off recovering from overworking the first four days. So not really, not really so much a benefit if you're trying to squeeze more hours into one day. And lastly, they offer 2000 per year charity match. So you want to give $2,000 to a specific charity base camp will match that up to $2,000 as well. I know Daniels company, my husband's company offers something similar to that. I don't know what the actual amount is. But he basically says if I'm ever going to donate to charity, ask him to look look at the list of like the charities that you can donate to that they match for. And if they match for it, then what Daniel actually did the donation so I think that's pretty cool, huh?

**Ali**  17:43  
Yeah, it's awesome.

**Kelly**  17:44  
So moving beyond all the great things about this camp. Let's actually talk about the book. I think we outline a few different sections that we read in the book. And if you haven't picked up this book yet, you'll notice that it's basically a lot of like bite sized pieces. That you can read at any given time, it's a really quick read. So we're it's going to seem like we're jumping from topic to topic kind of quickly here. But it's because they're very short. There's like

**Ali**  18:11  
a couple pages that max

**Kelly**  18:13  
exactly which I love because it means that if I don't have that much time to read, I can read a couple sections and sit down the book. And I'm like, in the middle of a chapter in the middle of a paragraph stopping. So let's talk about some of our favorite sections. Allie, you want to go first,

**Ali**  18:26  
the first that we have down here is don't negotiate salaries. So everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same, which is, I think, really cool that there's that transparency and so it is going to take away a lot of the discrimination and pay gaps that happen based off of the demographics of employees. So I think that's a really cool standpoint that they have.

**Emma**  18:52  
I think that's that would definitely help underrepresented groups intersectional groups minorities in that sense, it definitely would help me get over my anxiety about negotiation because I, I mean, you just heard me say I feel guilty, I would feel guilty taking a company paid vacation. Like, I don't feel good asking for more. I'm not very good about sticking up for myself. So I think it's good in that aspect. But I just want to say like, it's only good for these underrepresented minorities if they do the work to hire diverse people in the first place. So like, I just want to preface it with that they didn't really talk too much. They mentioned something about like, don't hire the resume hire the skill set, but I didn't hear them talk really about diversity at all, which is something I think that they should discuss. I'm curious to see how their diversity break down

**Ali**  19:40  
and also putting people in the right tier as well is not putting people from underrepresented backgrounds in a lower tier than they should be based on their experience.

**Kelly**  19:51  
For sure. I'd definitely be interested in reading more about that. One of the things that they also do as far as not negotiating salaries so they they post this salary for every position. But what's cool is that they're their goal is to actually pay everybody in the top 10% of the market. And they base their salaries around market value for San Francisco. They don't have any employees in San Francisco and Basecamp is headquartered out of Chicago as well. Right? Regardless of whether you live in like Kansas City, or Detroit, or like the smallest, little Americus, Georgia, a really small town in southern Georgia, you're going to get paid the same amount. So the cost of living is like the I think the goal is that regardless of where you live, you're not going to be underpaid for the cost of living in your area. I think it's great, but also for someone like me, I can't smash that. I can't pay people San Francisco salaries.

**Emma**  20:49  
Like I want us I want to be on board with this. And I do think on paper this all sounds good but to me like all of these things added up. sound too good to be true. Out of all of us. Benefits out of the fact that they don't negotiate and that they pay market rate option percent for San Francisco even though everyone's basically remote. Like it just sounds like they sat down and they made a list of things that like, kick every other businesses ass. And like I'm curious to see if they actually execute it as well as they claim to.

**Kelly**  21:20  
And that's one of the things that we mentioned as far as issues in the book which we'll get to eventually is that there are no like quotes or interviews from base camp in place in this book. And so it's a hard today Yeah, it's hard to say like hearsay

**Emma**  21:36  
heresy. I don't anymore I've lost my English. Yeah, it's it does seem like a lot of well, this is great. Our employees love it. Well, do they like I would love to hear from them just to see if this actually executes as well as it sounds like it. Yeah.

**Ali**  21:50  
Especially since the two founders have such massive platforms and not that is not so true for their employees. So, hearing from those employees in an unbiased, non filtered way, it would be really interesting.

**Kelly**  22:09  
I agree. I will say I'm trying to take this approach for the first time for hiring a developer, I went ahead and posted the salary alongside the position like but the job listing. And I've gotten some positive feedback from it that people like really appreciate the transparency and honestly, it's a huge weight off my shoulders to not have to worry about whether or not they're the people applying are okay with what I have to offer? Because I can't offer San Francisco salaries. So yes, there are definitely some people who are not going to be applying for the position because it's too low for them, but I have plenty others who are applying so it definitely does take a piece out of the stress puzzle for me and most likely for the people applying as well.

**Emma**  22:53  
Awesome. Let's Kelly, why don't you pick one of your favorites and let's discuss that.

**Kelly**  22:59  
Yeah. So one of my favorite sections, the book was productivity versus efficiency. And basically, in the this two page chapter, he talked about how many ways an hour can be split up. So it could be one block of 60 minutes, two blocks of 30 minutes, four blocks of 15 minutes or like five minutes, then 10 minutes, then 25 minutes or, you know, basically just breaking it into up to a lot of various chunks. And the whole takeaway from this is that you're going to be a lot more efficient with your time, if you're working in that full 60 minute block without interruption so to, you know, really understand where your interruptions are coming from. Are there people coming up to you or are you causing those interruptions? address them if you can, and be more efficient with your time. The piece about productivity versus efficiency is basically saying efficiency should take precedence over productivity in that you should work better and not see how much can I fit into this work?

**Ali**  24:00  
What'd you think about that section? I think that that's really true. I think one of my productivity hacks is to work on the same thing for under interrupted amounts of time. And I especially find if I have a bunch of calls with weird amounts of time in between them, it's really hard to do anything productive because it's like, you can get something open. But you can't really do any deep work in a 15 minute slot or even a half an hour slot. So yeah, I think this is super true and something that companies should really think about, I was just

**Emma**  24:31  
gonna say there's this concept of flow state where you get into these like mindsets where essentially time melts away, and you just kind of lose yourself in the work. And Jason Lynx Dorf had a really good talk about it. It was called how I cut my work hours and haven't managed to get more done. And he does talk about flow state and maybe the Pomodoro Technique, but like everyone's flow states are going to be different like mine. I think I'm really good in our long run. Some people need to chunk it up into 30 minute tasks. So I like that idea because it's not every person is a cookie cutter. Same, you know what I mean? Some people like to have to have some people like to have, you know, what's 60 divided by 320 minutes, how many minutes my brain is turning off. So I just like that idea. Because it's, it's saying not everyone works the same, and you can adjust it to your work style.

**Kelly**  25:28  
I like that. Yeah, I think that's an important point, especially, especially that the fact that people do work in different ways. I'm curious Ellie, you know, you say you work best when you're, you know, a full 60 minute or more or longer without interruptions. How do you handle the interruptions that that do come up, or do you like back them away somehow?

**Ali**  25:48  
It depends on the role. So when I'm in an engineering role, I think ignoring the distractions is easier. Now though, I'm accountable first to myself. Students so I do try to have blocks of time that I'm not on slack and not paying attention to notifications, but I prioritize them pretty highly. And so I think it is more difficult to ignore the interruptions there. But I definitely will have times especially when I'm working on my own side projects, where I have the internet off on my computer and I just have like a text editor up or something like that, or certain sites blocked on my computer.

**Kelly**  26:33  
How do you handle interruptions?

**Emma**  26:35  
I honestly like people talk about intuitive eating. I'm kind of like an intuitive worker where if I'm just not concentrating or not feeling it, I won't force myself to do it. Obviously if I have a deadline, that's different, but I think forcing myself to do things has negatively impacted me before like my burnout rate. Definitely. Got faster. I like I burned out a lot more quickly. When I force myself to do things I just was not in a mental state to do. And in all honesty, the quality of work that I produce wasn't great either. So if I'm just not concentrating, or I'm not feeling great emotionally or mentally, I won't force myself to do something. Instead, I will find an alternate time. Generally, yeah, I have a little less time to do it. But actually, the output is much stronger than it would have been if I had sat there enforcement's, like if I had sat down today and forced myself to work through an hour of studying algorithms for an interview. And I'm not in a good mindset, I'm not going to get a lot out of that. But if I wait until tomorrow, when I'm well rested, and in a better place, mentally, and I spent 30 minutes, it's gonna be a lot better output. Like, I'm going to actually learn more. And so that's kind of my mentality.

**Kelly**  27:42  
That's how I kind of roll as well. Especially I like if I'm operating and like 40% I'm going to produce 40% quality work. So I always keep that in mind

**Emma**  27:54  
goes back to psychology, like Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If your basic human needs aren't met, whether that's you're not in Physically secure. Like, if you're threatened by something in your environment, or if your emotional needs aren't met, or if you're hungry or tired, you're not going to be able to focus on the higher needs in that pyramid of, I don't know, concentrated, like you can't concentrate if you're starving or if you're exhausted. So focus on your well being for I think that's, that's what I did on Friday.

**Ali**  28:23  
I think that's so important to note, especially right now with everything that's going on in the world. And like I'm in New York City, it's basically apocalyptic here to be fluent. And so productivity is gonna look really different right now. And that's okay. You don't have to be forcing yourself to always be working in at your highest level of productivity. Like right now I'm taking on way less contract work than I normally do. And I'm just trying to be like patient with myself because there's a lot of stressful stuff going

**Kelly**  28:56  
on in the world and I completely agree. Um, I do want to talk about one Your favorite sections?

**Emma**  29:01  
Yeah. So one of the things that I thought was really impactful that kind of spoke to me was they'll do as you do, it sounds like I do we do you do. We all do, which is we talked about in our next episode releasing tomorrow, which is it's already been released by the time you're listening to this. So this concept of you can preach the best work life balance, but unless you're actually practicing it, no one's gonna follow it. People do as you do, they don't do what you say to do. If you're in the office until 8pm, your employees are going to stay just as late because they want to prove to you that they are working just as hard as you. And so if you're promoting a good work life balance and putting Family First you need to leave the office at a reasonable hour, whether that's five 530 or six. Yeah, it doesn't matter what you say it matters what you do. I like that.

**Kelly**  29:56  
Yeah, this section really resonated with me as well. I'm taking a leadership Of course through Kennesaw State University right now, and unless on the same line, your your employees do mirror not only your actions but your like they pick up on your emotions and your mental state and like just how you're how you're generally feeling. If you're giving off this, like, air of anxiety, they pick up on that. So even if like you're a little concerned about things, like especially right now is a very, very anxiety inducing time for me not knowing how we're going to be doing financially, just because if clients pull out, we have to find new clients to replace them. And I want to make sure my employees continue to get paid. So, you know, taking on more of a, like on the on the front facing side, you know, being more confident in in how we're, how we're looking for the weeks ahead, and being very transparent and open about that and processing my negative emotions more privately. I think It's been helpful for my employees at least. That's that's the idea I get. I know one of my employees in particular listens to all of our podcasts. So hi, Josiah. Let me know what you think of what I just said.

**Emma**  31:14  
Well, I think if you think about airline pilots, they test them for how they act under pressure and in intense situations, because as a passenger, you don't have a lot of control over the airplane, you literally have zero control over the airplane noise. I said a little. But in situations where there's something wrong, you notice the captains are always very calm mannered. And this is because it transfers to the passengers who don't really have control. This is kind of the same thing with what's going on with these businesses, maybe particularly small businesses who are suffering right now, as an owner of a small business during this kind of crisis that Kelly just mentioned, like you need to be, you need to kind of portray these types of calm mannerisms that your employees are going to have. absorb? This is exactly

**Kelly**  32:03  
No, no that if you've got it,

**Emma**  32:04  
yeah, but I think I mean, here's the thing, I'm not telling you your feelings aren't valid or that you shouldn't process them or feel them. But I do think that if you're in a position of power, whether that's an airline pilot in a crisis, or a small business owner in a pandemic, like your employees are looking to you, you are their security blanket. And I think that's, that's kind of where this chapter the book was coming from LA, you want to pick the next

**Ali**  32:28  
step? Yeah. So the next one is no goals, which I think is interesting and something that we've talked about in the past. I'm a big believer in this personally, I know I don't own a company with other employees. I have a company but it's just me. So the idea of trajectories and habits So going back to our discussion at atomic habits, which is still one of my favorite books, and so life changing, go listen to our episode on that if you haven't already, but the idea of cheese goals can lead companies to compromise on their morals, their honesty and their integrity in order to reach these fake numbers or these objectives that they have set. And the idea of failure or success riding on these artificial numbers is problematic and can lead to compromising on what actually matters. So think this concept of no goals was really interesting. How do you feel about it? Kelly as a business owner,

**Kelly**  33:30  
I honestly struggle with it. Because for me, I like I personally have goals set, whether their financial goals or the types of clients we take on or the average cost of our project for me, I by setting those goals, I'm kind of able to check in on my own progress and see what I can do to improve our workflow to hit the goals that I've set. Are they arbitrary goals. elute Lee, they mean absolutely nothing. And I've tried to keep that in a frame of reference when I miss a goal, that it's, it's totally fine. And honestly, like, I don't discuss what these goals are with my employees, there's this is something very, like, very personal. And I think that if I were to openly discuss it, as you said it can, it can compromise, you know, morals and integrity. And like if I want to make more money, like I don't want my, my employees to be, you know, fudging their hours a little bit saying something took longer than it actually did. So the client has a top of mine hours again, because they ran out of hours, and therefore we're making more money, but they're, you know, it's a lie of as to how much work we're actually getting done. So that's why I'm trying to keep them a little bit more private. I

**Emma**  34:44  
like that mentality because I do think to a certain extent, businesses need some semblance of a goal in order to have burndown charts and measure like, statistically how they compare to themselves last quarter, for example, but I love that you keep it private, because that removes this level of anxiety for your employees.

**Kelly**  35:04  
Yeah, I just I just want my employees to not only complete the work but be proud of the work that they do. And if they can't be proud of the work that they do, that means that I'm doing something wrong on the management side that I'm putting too much stress on just getting it done. Instead in Yeah, there are some times we have these like short deadlines, and it can be stressful completing the project. But it's not often that this happens. And so I try to find opportunities to give my team the the time and the headspace to be able to enjoy what it is that they're working on. This is a learning approach. Like I'm learning as I go, I don't I don't have everything figured out. But I very much take the feedback that I get from my team and apply it the best I can because if I were an employee at my own company, these are the things that I would want.

**Emma**  35:51  
I also want to say like, I think having high level goals at the the upper echelons of the company is not a bad thing, but I do think like my company is going overboard with his stupid software that they purchased called 15. Five. And this is like personal goal tracking and it's so freakin annoying and I still haven't filled it out to this day. We've had a subscription for months and I refuse to fill it out. Because every week they bother you. What's your goal for today? What's your goal for this week? Did you meet your goals? What are you how are you feeling at work? I'm like, I just stressful. It's stressful, and I ignore it completely. I'm like, why did you spend money on this? Because having like, weekly goals, it doesn't work for everyone. And when they don't meet it, they continually feel like they're not like, Good enough. And so those kinds of things, I think are actually detrimental.

**Ali**  36:37  
Yeah, I think acknowledging that everyone's different. It's so important to because I know some people are so motivated by goals and having the idea of like three set goals a day or whatever is incredible for some people, but then I am not very motivated. I like the more systematic approach the atomic habits type situation. So I I definitely think it's important to note that,

**Emma**  37:03  
yeah, for sure. Let's talk about structuring project.

**Kelly**  37:06  
Yeah, so this was one of my favorite sections in the book as well. So a few things that they do at Basecamp. First off, all of their projects are six week cycles. So there is a, like a finite start, and there's a finite end date. Second, there's smaller teams. So they're like two or three people per team. And Basecamp, in particular, doesn't really do so much in terms of like managers. So those who are working on that project there, they get to actually set like the short and medium term direction for whatever the project is. And then they'll receive feedback to make sure you know, the project's moving along as it should. But for the most part, it kind of gives the team working on that particular project the authority to set those goals and set the set the projection of the project. I think, giving that ownership to the team working on it is So, again, by taking ownership, you feel a lot more empowered to do a good job. And you'll feel more proud of that work in the end. So I really like the structuring projects section in particular.

**Ali**  38:11  
Yeah, this is so interesting to me, I, having good managers has been such an important thing for my career. I have mixed feelings about that. But I also understand that giving employees autonomy and ownership and leadership is really important as well and can be really motivational. And was something that early in my career working for an early stage startup was really impactful and allowed me to grow really fast. So I think I see both directions of this.

**Kelly**  38:44  
I do think it's important to note though, as far as giving your team the autonomy to to take ownership of a project, they have to know what it is that they're supposed to be doing. And this is such a such a missed point on a lot of managers in that They'll say, Hey, I'm going to give you this project to work on. And then I'm not going to provide any training on how you're actually going to do it. And I've seen it like I've had long conversations with some of my friends, and they're in their positions. They're like, I don't know what I'm doing. And when I asked for help, they're like, nevermind, I'll just do it myself. And so they're not learning from it. And so if you're going to give employees, a, like a group of employees or a single employee, a project or a task to work on, you have to be able to provide the guidance and the training on how they're going to do it. If you just leave them to figure it out on their own entirely. You're setting them up to fail. Can they figure it out? Sure. Maybe it really depends on what it is that they're working on. But if it was more at stake, you really have to be providing that leadership and then that that mentorship along the way.

**Emma**  39:44  
Yeah, speaking of mentorship, that was one issue I have with this book is they don't talk about it at all. They harped on the importance of benefits and no negotiation and project structure, but they didn't talk about mentorship which I kind of was waiting for and never got Should we switch gears and talk about some of the issues with this book? Yeah, let's start it. Let me just hammer out some of mine because I feel very passionate about it. Now, I'm gonna preface it with the fact that I do still think this is a valuable and a good book. It's easy to read. I do think there's a lot of good sentiments, but I did find some issues I want to discuss. So the authors who founded Basecamp, talk a lot about the benefits that their policies have for their employees, and they kind of preach it time and time again, but they actually fail. We fail to hear from these employees themselves. So I would have liked to see some quotes from current and past employees kind of testifying to these benefits instead of just hearing about it secondhand. We have already kind of touched on that a little bit. So Secondly, the author's seem to contradict themselves, likely due to a lack of providing details. So I mean, each chapter is really short, which is good because it's digestible. But because there was that lack of detail, this, these contradictions were pretty prevalent. So for example, they have this idea of meeting free work time. So they they don't want meetings, but then at the same time They focus on remote work. So how are you actually getting work done is kind of my question. That was a big one. The second example of this was they talked about, oh, our employees don't need to tell us when they need to leave the office. Like we don't keep track of who's where, like people will get back to us when they can. But then they said in a later chapter that, well, if an employee needs to leave or work early to pick up their kid, they just have to drop a note into slack or something. And then like, let the team know. So I'm like, which is it? Like, are your employees like, free to do whatever they want when they need to? Or do they have to kind of like report into their team, just like these little, little tiny things kind of bother me. And I think the last big issue I had was this consensual decision making. So they discussed how consensus is never feasible. So you shouldn't aim for a consensual decision. But it's a very American based mindset and other parts of the world. They make decisions solely based through consensus. So in Germany, it's a very consensual decision making culture. So America's very open to top down decision making culture but not every culture sees it this way, it'd be really great if they could have recognized this instead of just preaching like you're never going to reach consensus to don't even bother. Yeah, how do y'all feel about those points?

**Kelly**  42:14  
So I just kind of want to touch on the, the one thing you mentioned in that last point that this is an American company. And there's like, what works for Basecamp is not necessarily going to be working for, you know, other companies around the world or even within the US. And I think that's like, they kind of preach these ideas as this is what like, this is the truth. This isn't what you should be doing for your company. And it's hard when reading it being like, Oh, yes, this is exactly what I should be doing. But also, I can't do it. For whatever reason, there are some things that you're just not going to be able to do. And I think that's that was one of my issues with the book is that it kind of sets this like high standard that's not attainable.

**Ali**  42:57  
I agree. Yeah,

**Emma**  42:58  
that's what it is. That's exactly what I couldn't put my Yeah,

**Ali**  43:02  
I think also reading this, I was thinking that I wouldn't do great in this work situation. It seems to be a very introvert friendly workspace where they're not huge on meetings, they're not huge on discussing things. They're not big on having a physical office, they're really big on remote work, which is all awesome for a lot of people and their values are very apparent throughout the whole entire book. But for me, personally, I would feel super isolated and having personal connections is one of my biggest motivators at work. And so I think I would really, really struggle in a workplace that has such infrequent and in some ways, impersonal communications, for sure.

**Kelly**  43:51  
I also want to bring in so we we did get some comments on our Goodreads group, which by the way, if you're not a part of our Goodreads group, you should absolutely join it. There. is a link to it on our website. So Tom also actually brought the same topic that this is, like the way Basecamp operates is very much in American style management. And that he, he's Belgian. And so a lot of companies like in Belgium don't work the same way. Kind of aligning with with what Emma was saying, and also that that base camp is privileged to be in a position where they're doing well, and they're able to provide these benefits for their employees. And like I said earlier, like, I can't provide all this same level of benefits. So in a way, it kind of makes me feel like I'm not doing as well. And it's just a very different company. I don't have the same I don't have the Basecamp budget. I'm still paying 29 a month for base camp and 100 a month would

**Unknown Speaker**  44:47  
push my

**Kelly**  44:48  
budget a little bit more as it is so like, offering all these benefits to to these employees is great, but again, it's not necessarily attainable in every single small business.

**Emma**  45:01  
situation they like, yeah, like Tom's comment about they seem to be in a privileged position where the company is doing well enough to be able to provide all these things to their employees. This is not they're an outlier base camp as an outlier, they I can't say they've had it easy because I don't know the whole background, but for for companies producing books about remote work and about work life balance, and how they do all these things, I would have liked to see more, I guess mention of the fact that this is not how typical companies operate, and maybe some guidance on how to transition, maybe facets of company life to achieve some of these goals, because there wasn't like a migration plan or anything like that. It was simply like, this is how we do it, and everything was great, and we're successful. So that would have been nice, Although to be fair, like I do think that a lot of this. If we look at the thesis statement for the book, it's, we've built Basecamp and these are our goal, or these are like how we I guess our mission And statements. That's it. Like they weren't exactly promising us that they were going to tell other companies how to migrate into this. So like for me, I guess I'm setting the wrong expectations. But I don't know. I would have liked to see maybe a little bit more.

**Kelly**  46:14  
La, you had a couple other issues with the book you want to discuss this?

**Ali**  46:18  
Yeah. Another one that I took issue. With was the passages on discomfort always being a negative, I can pull up the quotes from the book. But they talked about how discomfort is the human response to a questionable or bad situation, whether that's working long hours with no end in sight, exaggerating your business numbers to impress investors, selling intimate user data, essentially seems to frame discomfort is always a negative but from a learning perspective, being uncomfortable with something when you're Just first starting to learn it is very, very natural and what you have to overcome in order to learn anything and to grow. And so I think it's kind of dangerous to be like discomfort is always bad because in order to grow, you often have to be dis comfortable early on in that process. So that was something that I noted.

**Emma**  47:24  
I love that you just turn that into a word discomfortable. I'm going to use that.

**Unknown Speaker**  47:30  
Because when you said it, I was like, I know exactly what she means. But then I was part of me was like, is that a word? I don't

**Emma**  47:36  
know. I think uncomfortable is the word. But in all honesty, I like yours better. So I'm going to use cool. I think this is one of the last issues that we took as a book, which was common goodbyes. So the premise here was if you don't clearly communicate to everyone while why someone was let go or fired, the people who were mad at the company will kind of come up with their own stories to explain it. And so you need to basically either let the employee who's leaving tell everyone why they are leaving Or when they do leave you tell everyone why they left and I think that's a violation of privacy personally like, if someone gets fired, like, is that really everyone else's business? Like I think you need to address the fears of and be honest about the fears of like, everyone questioning, am I getting fired to like, but I don't necessarily think everyone needs to know why Jerry got fired.

**Kelly**  48:22  
Yeah. Can you like imagine making a fatal mistake on a project getting fired over it? And that having it put on blast of the incumbent entire company, like, yeah, Jerry is no longer with us because he deleted this database and we lost a ton of information like, okay, Jerry made a mistake. And yes, it was a bad mistake. But as nobody's been asked,

**Unknown Speaker**  48:42  
delete star from Jerry's career.

**Ali**  48:45  
So agreed, especially because the people who did have positive experiences with Jerry could probably be a positive reference if they weren't super filled. Sadly, yeah, I so agree. I that whole part of the book made me cringe really hard.

**Emma**  49:03  
There is always the victim. I don't know why I always choose Jerry Jerry. But Jerry is doing good. Now. Speaking of Jerry, let's segue into something unrelated. So Kelly mentioned earlier, we do have a Goodreads group and we have some some really thoughtful responses. So I just want to say thank you to Courtney and Tom who both participated. Courtney had some good thoughts. So she said, the book focuses mostly on the workplace environment, that base campus thoughtfully implemented and cultivated over their 15 plus years in business. Although I would have liked to see more sources backing up some of their claims. I appreciate and agreed with most of their sentiments. This thread of working too much not enough sleep, All work and no play is nothing new. It's free dimension. You can find these quotes of hustle mentality all around the internet and social media. I was it was refreshing to read about a company who has tried the typical methods only recognize that ended up being a zero sum situation. So going against the grain they were able to find healthier advantages that suited their business holistically. That's a beautiful thing. Beautiful response like, hats off to you, Courtney because that was eloquently stated. And I fully agree with everything that you just said.

**Kelly**  50:07  
I completely agree. So let's finish this episode by giving our rating how many ladybugs?

**Emma**  50:15  
I give four spots on the ladybug, I'm switching a spot. So my Ladybug has four spots. I liked it, but there were some problems.

**Ali**  50:22  
Yeah, I think I would agree with that. Three or four.

**Kelly**  50:25  
I'll probably put it at four as well. I think I don't think it was a perfect book. But I think it was better than three. Maybe even like a No, I'll stick with four. I think four is good. I was only going to give like a quarter spot. But no,

**Emma**  50:38  
we only do a hole spots here. Nice. Well, if you liked this episode, tweet about it. We normally select one tweeter to win a Smashing Magazine book. And I think we still really want to continue to do that might be a little hard given the current situation, but maybe we'll come up with some different kind of giveaway that we can do for our listeners. So in the meantime, continue to tweet and maybe we'll come up with a fun little giveaway. For all of you also leave us a review. If you like our podcast, leave us a review on Apple podcasts. We read all of them, they make us feel really good. And they let us know that we're on the right trajectory, not goal. We haven't hit our goal. We don't do goals. Maybe we do. We don't have a goal. But let us know what you think. And

**Ali**  51:16  
I think we've brought it up a couple times in this episode, but again, we're talking about productivity and all that but it's okay. If you're not productive right now. It's okay. If you're anxious right now, it's okay. If you're stressed, it's okay. if things aren't going right. That's perfectly normal. I'm in the same boat as you are. If you're going through that, and stay safe out there social distance, don't get anybody else sick. Follow those best practices.

**Emma**  51:44  
It doesn't have to be crazy at work, but it can be crazy in life. So take care of yourself

**Unknown Speaker**  51:49  
first. That's a perfect summary.

**Kelly**  51:51  
We'll see you next week. Bye.
