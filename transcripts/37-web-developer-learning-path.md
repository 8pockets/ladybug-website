There's so many ways to learn to code and so many things to know. Today we'll give our perspectives on different paths you can take, whether you're looking for your first dev job or you're looking to advance your web development knowledge. We'll be covering a ton of different options for you. Make sure you check the show notes for important resources in a PDF version of our developer Matt. Also, we have officially reached the end of season two. We'll be taking the rest of April off, but we'll be back in your favorite podcasting app starting May for it. Let's dig in.

**Kelly** 0:35  
Welcome to the Ladybug Podcast. I'm Kelly.

**Ali** I'm Ali.

**Emma** And I'm Emma. And we're debugging the tech industry.

**Kelly** 0:43  
Are you a developer looking for your next challenge meet Shopify. They're on a mission to make commerce better for everyone. And they do things a bit differently. They don't tell you how to solve problems. They give you the tools, trust and autonomy to build new solutions. They don't want you to work alone. They're stressed Sure, so you can leverage the diverse perspectives across teams and everything you do. And they don't pretend to have all the answers. They're big enough for you to tackle problems at scale, but small enough for you to discover and solve new problems. If you're a builder at heart, who wants to solve highly technical problems, if you want to take all of your life experiences and apply them to a blank canvas, or if you want to access really powerful tools, Shopify is the place for you.

**Ali** 1:27  
Though starting off to kick off the discussion, I can only put a disclaimer in this whole episode that this is a trick title. And there's no one singular way to learn to code or no one singular get of skills in order to advance or become a developer or get your first job. Every single one of us had a different skill set before getting our first job. So let's go ahead and do a quick, rapid fire around of what we knew going into our first developer jobs. Kelly, you want to go first?

**Kelly** 1:58  
Yes, I know nothing. Um, so I've never actually had like a proper developer job, except for the one that I created for myself. All of my life has been freelancing. So I started learning how to code when I was 11. I focused solely on the friend. So I was doing HTML and CSS and frame sets, super fun. Um, JavaScript scared the crap out of me. I tried to stay away from it as far as I could. I continue to figure out more like learn more and more, but I was really focusing just on freelancing. I always said they did want to make it my full time job because I would grow to hate it if I was forced to do it. Haha, Joke's on me. Um, and I think the only time I really really did any development work in like a professional environment outside of the the short stint I had at the University of West Georgia in their college education department was at CDC, when they needed somebody who had their master's in public health Who could also code? So I was the lone wolf applicant for that one. And obviously, I got the position. But yeah, so basically all that to say, I didn't really know much. I didn't know so much about what it was like to work in a professional environment. And so I just jumped right in. But yeah, I focused solely on front end HTML, CSS, and now I know JavaScript. Well, Emma. I studied mostly back in school. So I came out knowing mostly Java, my sequel, MIPS, and that's about it. I took one web dev class, once I found out I was switching to French and all of a sudden, and so I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap, PHP, and I think that was it. But it was like a week on each of them. And we spent half the time watching bad lip reading videos, so I didn't learn as much as I should have. So by the time I got to my full time job, I was utterly overwhelmed and I actually had to spend an absurd amount of time learning and I was actually pretty good. I wasn't going to make it. So it took me it took me about a year and a half to two years to actually really get into web development and learn a modern framework and libraries. So the first real framework I learned was view, although I was working with dojo, and that was an absolute nightmare, especially when you don't really know what you're doing. So that was kind of what I knew going into my first job. How are you? Allie?

**Ali** 4:22  
Depends on what you count as a first developer job. So I was a teaching assistant for my school's computer science department. So my first job and I took that position immediately after taking my first ever programming class, which was in Python. So I knew of the Python fundamentals and that's absolutely it. And then I learned c++ the following semester, and then after that ended up accidentally getting my first software engineering job. And so I knew c++ and Python and not a huge amount of depth to either I think I did code Academy's HTML and CSS lessons. So I had this on my resume too, but I hadn't really done anything with them. And in fact, I mostly just use bootstrap for the first couple years of my career. But I learned almost entirely on the job. And I feel really lucky to have had that investment in myself that I didn't know a time going into that first job. But I was able to grow and learn so much super fast. So really lucky to have that,

**Kelly** 5:29  
I realized that I cut out about six to eight years of my life story. When I was talking to mine. I did a lot of WordPress development, a lot of WordPress development. So I spent a lot of time in PHP and trying to understand my sequel, and it was very different or very difficult. Kind of just like jumping right into it. It did not make any sense to me. I'm not a back end developer even now. Like I try and I can like, understand sort of what the code is supposed to be doing. But if you asked me to write the next section can't do it, it happens. Um, we did an amazing or one of my favorite episodes that we've done really early on about different paths that you can take to learn to code. So whether that be boot camps or self directed learning, or computer science, and our paths in more depth as well. So if you're interested, go ahead and listen to that episode, because it'll give you a lot more basis for what path that you should take. This episode will be more like what are the tangible skills

**Ali** 6:32  
that you should know and what specialization to go into from there rather than what different paths you can take more generally.

**Unknown Speaker** 6:41  
Cool. So let's talk about t shaped knowledge. And I know we've touched on it in previous episodes as well. But Allie, do you want to explain again, what that is,

**Ali** 6:51  
there's always this question of whether you should have a lot of shallow knowledge about different things or you should have deep knowledge on one thing and I think that the answer is actually somewhere in between. For most people, there are specialists who just know really deep knowledge about one thing. And there are people who are more broad and go into consulting roles where they know a little bit about a lot. But I think the perfect happy medium is t shaping your knowledge, especially if you're looking for your first job. So you know, something's in shallow depth, but then you have your specialization where you focus really deep on one thing, so whether that be react or view or Python, or the front end fundamentals or something along those lines, you have your one space of specialization, and that's where you're really looking hard for jobs. But then you also have no shot you have shallow knowledge in, okay, I know how to build a basic server and can spin that up or I know how the web works or I can write a Hello World and these different things. So think having t shaped knowledge. This is something that Emma talked about. Got it a lot as well, is the best way to go especially at first,

**Emma** 8:04  
definitely. And we talked on our last episode about learning how to learn. So we discussed different learning styles and the fact that your preferred learning style might not be the most effective learning style for you. So if you haven't listened to that, we'll link it in the show notes. It's definitely an important resource to learn. I think it's actually more effective if you understand the most effective learning style for you before you actually jump into learning things because you're going to make the most out of everything that you're consuming. So that's just a little precursor. But I think let's just jump right into the front end side of things. And let's talk about HTML. Now, HTML does not get as much notoriety as JavaScript in the front end development world in terms of how difficult it is to learn and whatever. I mean, it isn't as difficult to learn as JavaScript. I will say that, however, don't take that for granted. It's still something you need to learn, especially if you're doing for an in technical interview. Which we have several different episodes on from the season as well. But learning how semantic HTML works is going to be very important to your growth as a web developer. Because everything we do in the DOM, we're going to be touching with our JavaScript code. So one of the biggest things with semantic HTML is going to be accessibility. So basically, we have semantic HTML elements. This is going to be like main body navigation. And why are these important to us is because we have users who are navigating our webpages with the help of assistive technology or screen readers. And these semantic HTML elements give them a way to easily navigate around our pages. If we're using non semantic elements like divs, and span to code our entire site, someone who's visually impaired using these tools is not going to understand how to navigate our website and actually probably can't use half of it. This can lead to lawsuits, but it's also not very nice. Like it's not ethical to actually cut out a portion of your potential user so everyone is able to use Your applications. Now, that being said, there are some instances when you want to create a custom drop down, for example, where you can't use the native HTML element. And sometimes HTML doesn't provide the elements you need. And that's where you're going to use div and span. But we still need to add this additional capability in called wait Aria. It's written by the Web Accessibility Initiative. And it Aria stands for Accessible rich internet applications, I believe. And essentially, they're just a series of HTML attributes and values that you add to your HTML elements to make them accessible. So if I have a drop down, that is created with a div, I can set roll equal drop down or something of the sort. And some additional properties just to tell us the search technology, what this is, what it controls, what does it do, etc. So this is very, very important when we're coding HTML. And we need to do I think, another deep dive into web accessibility because it's so massive, I could go on forever about it. But it's something you should definitely not take for granted. So that's, in my opinion, foundational, semantic. HTML is stuff One to understanding the web. And if supporting the, you know, screen readers and everything, when you're when you're coding isn't enough of an incentive to focus on this. There are a lot of lawsuits around websites not being accessible. And I mean, there, there are some big names getting sued because of it. Like, I think Beyonce was one of them. I see it a lot in the e commerce world. And there are companies just like they literally exist just to go after websites that aren't accessible. It's something that's really, really, really worth your time. Another thing to note about HTML is understanding the DOM tree at its basic route. Basically, the fact that you know, your documents are tree structures and understanding how to navigate that so that we can actually manipulate and dynamically generate doc DOM content or HTML content with our JavaScript. So those are the kind of the two big areas you're going to want to be familiar with. And I think from there, it's safe to say we have the structure of our way And at that point, we can go and add some styling to it. So let's shift gears and talk about CSS. Kelly, do you want to take this one? Yeah. So instead of going into a super deep dive here, we have two episodes on CSS that we will link to in our show notes that are that go much more in depth. So just kind of running through the types of things that you're going to want to look at. And again, listen to the previous episodes to get a little bit more understanding about what it is that we're talking about. But first off is going to be specificity. As far as the the order of the styling, I'm trying to figure out how the best way to explain specificity specificity are the mathematical calculations, or the set of rules that determine how styles are applied to your DOM element. So the most specific wins, see, why don't you just explain all these things? Okay, to be fair, I'm really good HTML, CSS, and then my JavaScript is mediocre best. So

**Ali** 12:58  
I think that that's an important conversation for us to have two is that even among us, we all have different specializations. And all of us can write HTML and CSS and JavaScript. But some of us have our T's shaped a little bit differently. Like for me, I would rather write JavaScript any day of the week. And then Emma just said, she is kind of an HTML and CSS expert. So even if you're listening to this, like don't compare yourself to us, and we still fit under these specializations have different skills with and there's

**Unknown Speaker** 13:30  
also the fact that I've been writing HTML and CSS for 18 years now. 19 years now, and I still struggle to explain the concept the

**Unknown Speaker** 13:39  
majority of my life exactly, it is over.

**Unknown Speaker** 13:41  
I've been coding for over two thirds of my life, Kelly

**Unknown Speaker** 13:44  
Kelly's 47 I don't think we've ever publicly.

**Unknown Speaker** 13:47  
I just I had several birthdays this week, I guess.

**Unknown Speaker** 13:52  
I don't know. That's what

**Ali** 13:53  
she's done to all of us.

**Unknown Speaker** 13:55  
I like to say that maybe I'm a CS expert and CS careful.

**Unknown Speaker** 14:00  
Didn't work stop trying to make fetch. Yeah, I don't know, this feels a little dirty. I wasn't thinking like that. But thank you. Anyway,

**Unknown Speaker** 14:08  
just a couple of other areas of CSS, you're gonna want to be familiar with quite familiar with a special unit front end interview, our inline versus block elements, this is going to be very important, and determines how things are rendered on our web pages. The box model Kelly has a beautiful Twitter photo of her sitting in a box explaining the box model, but this is essentially you've got your element content, your padding, your border, and then your margin. Responsive Design is another important area. This deals with media queries, Flexbox, and grid animations, specifically keyframes, you're also going to want to learn about positioning. So absolute fixed relative, I can't remember if there's another one gi stick. I don't I just like the word is another sound. It's not anyway,

**Unknown Speaker** 14:50  
I have no idea,

**Ali** 14:52  
though. It's for mostly like navbars.

**Unknown Speaker** 14:55  
It's like the same, I think fixed would probably do the same.

**Unknown Speaker** 14:58  
It's not exactly the same. They must also I don't think the support is the same for it across browsers.

**Unknown Speaker** 15:03  
That's all right. And then just a couple other things, our display. So display inline block display, this goes back to inline versus block elements. And then lastly, mobile first. So understanding how to develop a website for mobile first. And then as we enlarge our browser, what breaks and what do we need to shift around. So those are just a couple of basic CSS, then we have a couple of different libraries you might want to be familiar with, at least from a conceptual perspective. So these are things like preprocessors. So we're talking about sass, or what's the other one less is another

**Unknown Speaker** 15:35  
process less still use? I'm sorry,

**Unknown Speaker** 15:37  
I think I mean, it's probably used in some applications. But I if you're going to learn a processor, I'd say sass. That being said, CSS and j s, we should do a whole episode about but those types of paradigms are becoming much more popular than sass. Just at a high level. Why preprocessors are really, really great for additional functionality like mix ins, which are just functions that return bits of code based on parameters. You know, variables, nesting, things like that. But they did help kind of solve the scope leaking problem of your styles, that CSS just neatly does not have scope styling, but CSS and j. s is the newer paradigm for web dev that I'm personally on board with. But it's kind of removing focus from pre processors. So just be aware of that. And then lastly, just some, what are these called UI libraries. So bootstrap zurb, Foundation, Houdini shocker, UI tailwind, CSS, those kinds of UI frameworks are incredible for quickly building out you eyes, especially if you're not good at design, but also take a look at design systems, because material UI from Google is really good carbon design system is also really good. Those are just some things in terms of styling, that will definitely help you become a great web developer.

**Ali** 16:50  
Yeah, and I think that these things have kind of escalated as the wall as we've gone through them is that pretty much any web developer should know the difference between inline and block The box model if especially if you are somebody who's writing CSS on a daily basis, but then if we're getting into something like Houdini that's like kind of expert level CSS and at the edge of what you should know as and I would say the same is true with more complexity animations is that those are the expert level type things. Whereas some things like mobile first is something that you will hundred percent use and is more of a fundamental. So these are all really, really important skills, but you don't need to know everything. That's something we talked a lot about on here. I can always learn some things in the future. But this is a really great list of things in general to learn.

**Unknown Speaker** 17:44  
Also, this is just a lot there are so many freaking tools out there and technology is and if you were to try to understand conceptually, like for me when I was starting was really hard to understand what's called what's run through the same kind of thing. Why would I use one or the other. This is all Very, very confusing. And so don't get frustrated. ask the questions to your team. If you have that ability, or ask online on Twitter, you're welcome to also message us if you have questions about like, what's ESPN? I don't understand. We're happy to help. So with that, I think it's time to talk about

**Unknown Speaker** 18:16  
JavaScript. I'm going to pass this over to LA, do you want to walk through the fundamentals of what's what's good to learn?

**Ali** 18:23  
Yeah, for sure. So I think the first fundamentals to learn JavaScript are the fundamentals of programming. So what is the function? What is the loop? What is a variable? What is scope, those basic fundamentals of programming that will be seen within JavaScript and Python, c++, and really anything that you go further in? Outside of JavaScript, learning those fundamentals first is probably the the first piece of JavaScript and then from there, we go into the front end specific world of JavaScript of DOM manipulation and event listeners and the event loop and all of that. So how does the browser listen for user interaction? How does it respond to that? And how can we make it so that our user interfaces are interactive using JavaScript. So I would say that that's the first year of JavaScript. So if you want just to dip your toes in the water, that's what I would learn. But then if you want to become more of a JavaScript specialist, then it becomes more important to learn what's going on under the hood. So things like the prototype chain and inheritance and then event delegation and bubbling and the how the event loop really works underneath the hood, and more advanced scope things closures, functional programming, different paradigms, object oriented programming, all of that can fit under this JavaScript hood if you are looking to go more in depth, especially if you're looking to level up Then once you move past those fundamentals of the things that are built into the JavaScript language itself, we can go a little bit further and learn about things like frameworks and libraries. So react view Angular, we did a whole episode on these and their pros and cons and why you would use one or the other. I think if you are learning looking to learn just one, I would go for reactor view at this point in web development history, I think react has the most jobs. And so learning that if you are looking for your first job would be a great strategy. On the other hand view, in my opinion, is the simplest to learn. So if you're looking for something with a more flat learning curve than view could be the way to go there. So I would focus on learning one of those frameworks or libraries in depth if you are looking to learn or just to get started because there's a ton of overlap the idea of a company Based hierarchy and state management and passing data from component to component, that's a theme from each one of these languages, or each one of these frameworks and libraries to the other. So you don't need to know everything, you don't need to know all of them, I would focus on one.

**Unknown Speaker** 21:17  
And next season, we're going to be doing a little bit of a deeper dive into JavaScript as well, talking about things like functional programming and doing it a whole episode on intermediate JavaScript as well, which I'm really excited because I don't know any of these things. I'm really excited for that, too. They're things that you definitely 110% needs to know if you're going to front end technical interview, they might even ask you to find some of these terms, which I don't necessarily agree with. But you might be asked and you might have to answer. So I'm excited for that episode. I think one of the most valuable things that I have learned and I'm still really learning how to do better is debugging for JavaScript. It's whether you're you know, just using like the debugger like built into Dev Tools or however, you know, makes the most sense based on whatever it is that you're building, I find that understanding how debugging works, really passes on to whatever it is that you're you're building with JavaScript.

**Ali** 22:12  
I learned so much from our debugging episode, just me personally, we had an amazing guest for that. So definitely go listen.

**Unknown Speaker** 22:23  
For sure, and there are just maybe a couple other areas, if you want to learn more about JavaScript, and you've kind of run through the fundamentals, and those are going to be SPS and pw A's, which stands for single page applications and progressive web applications. I'm not 100% sure how to define a single page application. I was asked this the other day, and I'm like, Ah, there's one page, I don't know. And then, but I think progressive web apps or web pages that allow you to actually save it to your homescreen on a mobile device, if I'm not mistaken. I don't know if there are other benefits as well. Maybe like service workers. It's super hyper fast, because basically it gets killed. cached on load. And so it doesn't have to keep on loading all the contents on the page. If nothing has actually changed. I'm really big on on progressive web apps, I wish I had more opportunity to to build with them. Our, you'll see a lot of that with with react and view, building out like frameworks that are progressive web apps. Also, definitely static site generators. I forgot about this. These are going to be really great too. These are things like Gatsby Next Next, I don't know which is for view on which is for react was Misano, Jekyll. These are basically like Gatsby in particular, we actually, that'd be a fun episode to talk about static site generators. But basically, you get to write a react application. And then it compiles down to just HTML and CSS files that you can then host on GitHub for free or things like that are deployed to nullify they rehydrate back into react application in the UI. So they're really really performant and great for access to and things like that. And speaking of fast performance, that's one other area that you're going to want to be aware of. for JavaScript, we do have we did a performance episode, didn't we web performance?

**Ali** 24:11  
Yeah, pretty much the TLDR is to use lighthouse testing as

**Unknown Speaker** 24:18  
well. That being said, though, to just as a preface there is lighthouse is actually a little bit inconsistent. I don't know if it's inconsistent for performance as well. But accessibility wise, it's very, not very inconsistent with results, which I didn't know. So just be aware of that if you rerun it the same test on the same page multiple times, you might get different results.

**Ali** 24:39  
Oh, interesting. I haven't seen that. But I think it's important to say that it is a first step. But if you are just like a total beginner to performance, it gives you step by step instructions on how to fix performance issues on your site, and how to make it into a progressive web app. And so as far as beginner friendly tools go, I think that it's awesome.

**Unknown Speaker** 24:59  
So now let's jump To the back end. And I'm, again going to pass this over to Allie, because she is our back end queen. Yeah. So

**Ali** 25:09  
as far as back end goes, I like to advise that new developers and people just starting out, at least have an understanding of how the backend works. So maybe just be able to spin up an express server or something along those lines connected to a database. It doesn't have to be crazy in depth, you don't have to be an expert by any means. But just understanding how a front end connects to a back end or to an API or how you build a simple API. It goes a long way. And it makes it so that you can communicate well with other developers. And I think that's the same thing is true for all of these skills. So if even if you're not writing HTML every day, the ability to discuss with the HTML developer what's going on and to understand from that, perspective, what they do. That goes a long way. And so I think the same thing is true is even if you're a front end developer having a very, very rudimentary knowledge of the back end goes a long way. And the same thing is true for back end developers having a rudimentary knowledge of the front end, and what HTML, CSS JavaScript are, what they do, and you can build like a simple web page, that's really important. So for the back end, you can just use JavaScript if you don't want to learn another programming language if you're coming from the front end. But I think this is another chance to pick up a secondary programming language. And the reason that I like to advise a second programming language is because learning one once you know, one already is such a shallow learning curve. And you already know the fundamentals of loops, and arrays and conditionals and functions and all those things. And so you're just looking at that in a different syntax. And so it can help reinforce those fundamentals but it's can also make it so that you have the confidence To apply to a job that is outside of the primary language that you've been working in. So languages that I recommend to early career developers would be Python node, which we've been talking about for JavaScript, Ruby, and then PHP to some extent as well. So with Python, you could also learn Django, which is an amazing web framework built into it. I know you could learn something like express to build web apps with that. And then Ruby has the amazing rails community, and that would be the way to go if you learn Ruby. I'm less knowledgeable about the PHP community, but there are lots of other frameworks out there like Laravel, WordPress, Drupal. probably keep going for a long time there.

**Unknown Speaker** 27:49  
There. Yeah, there are a bunch of them that I think we mentioned it or I added it to the list because WordPress is still very much around and There are plenty of people still building on the platform. And so PHP can be can be worth reading or worth learning. We're still building some of our apps in PHP. I'm running Shopify scripts with PHP as well.

**Ali** 28:15  
Yeah, a huge percentage of the web is built on PHP. My only guidance would be to look up pay categories for the different things that you're learning. Just in my experience, and I don't know if this is actually universal, or just the studies that I've lived in is that PHP jobs tend to pay less than the other jobs that we've been talking about in this episode. And so that's just something to note. I'm not sure if that's even universally true. It's just something that I've noticed with the cities that I've lived in. While we're on the back end. There are other pieces to this as well of deployment and DevOps of building out systems so that your application is going to be consistent. for end users and has a testing framework built in so that you're writing these automated tests, and making sure that broken code isn't going into production. In addition, there's database management, so using SQL or no SQL database, and understanding how data is stored in there, and also retrieved from that database, so things like queries, I think SQL is the most widely used and so that would be the direction that I would go and Postgres is my favorite open source, and really accessible so I'd really recommend learning a database and basic SQL, it's kind of like HTML, where it won't take you years and years to learn a couple SQL.

**Unknown Speaker** 29:46  
There are actually a lot of people outside of the developer community who knows SQL like that's that's what they learn. I know excuse me out of like, research studies. For running like for analyzing your your Study data. It's used in like standard standard businesses. I think it's I think it's super cool. And I hear just people who are completely like non technical careers, talk about everything they know a sequel, I'm just like, this is awesome.

**Ali** 30:15  
Yeah. And business analysts, they tend to use a lot of SQL as well. I dated a business guy for a while, and he knew SQL. And that was his form of programming, talked about it all the time to impressing

**Unknown Speaker** 30:28  
your husband knows some SQL. He also knows PowerShell, which is something I know nothing about the same.

**Unknown Speaker** 30:39  
So what is what is routing?

**Ali** 30:41  
routing is how URLs work. And so how, what happens when you go to a certain URL, and what is retrieved? What's the code that runs, and then you're also writing route so URLs that make sense and follow certain patterns. That's kind of what routing is. And

**Unknown Speaker** 31:00  
nice, but it kind of fits into how the web works. Like in general, you should know how the web works. So HTTP versus HTTPS, perhaps you want to know about TCP IP, oh, my God, all of these different acronyms. So you definitely want to know how that works, especially like I said, again, if you're going to be going to a web developer technical interview, they're going to be asking you some of these things. So I think that's an important thing points to make. If you're let's say, I'm applying for a position that I am purely going to be working on the front end, well, should I be expected to be asked to these questions like on things like routing and databases still? Not databases, you might be asked questions like I have been asked multiple times, like if you enter Google COMM And your URL, or like in your browser and hit enter what happens and you have to walk through the whole process of how pages are requested. What happens if your request fails, all about packets and how like TCP IP You know, split your data into packets, but also make sure that they all arrive, things like that. But there are plenty of YouTube videos that actually help make this digestible for people. So definitely recommend checking out YouTube to help explain some of those console.

**Unknown Speaker** 32:12  
So now let's shift into testing. Because I think testing is

**Unknown Speaker** 32:18  
becoming more and more popular. I feel like having been in the front end role for quite some time, it always was only until recently I heard people like really talking about testing, it can't be a new concept. So what is your experience with with testing? I also quickly before I answer I just want to say you're not going to be you should not be asked questions about testing or any of the other topics we're going to cover up until you know the end where we talk about data structures and algorithms. The next several topics are just for your personal learning and your work on an actual team. Building a product. So test. We're going to talk testing tooling, Dev Tools. Get potentially even the terminal next. And so those topics you're not going to be quizzed on in a technical interview. So anything you can write code for, or has to do with, like day to day programming. In terms of performance, accessibility, those things you'll be asked, you won't be asked about testing you should not be. I have been really I've done a shit ton of interviews, and I've never once been asked about it.

**Ali** 33:23  
Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting. I think testing might be more eponymous in the back end world. So more widely used and more expected. So good point. And the different teams that

**Unknown Speaker** 33:40  
were you asked, were you asked to write testing code, though?

**Ali** 33:43  
No, just when would you write a test? Well,

**Unknown Speaker** 33:45  
that's Yeah, yeah. So conceptually, you might be asked questions about like, are you even familiar that any libraries exist? If so, like, what have you worked with, but they won't ask you to physically write these tests? Maybe I should have clarified that you won't be expected to write tests in a technical interview. Yes.

**Ali** 34:00  
We talked about this though in our code challenged episode, that if you write tests for your code challenge that looks really, really good. And it's something that I look for when I grade them. So testing is writing code that tests your other code. So you're making sure that when you write new code, you're not breaking your old code, essentially, that everything is doing exactly what you want it to do. On the front end world. There are a ton of different libraries for this, mocha Chai jest, enzyme, Cypress snapshot testing, integration testing, we can keep going on and on and on with these different types of testing, and the different libraries that are out there for this. But I think the idea of being able to write a unit test and explain what it is is really important. I know when I worked for Dev, we had to have 99% test coverage or something along those lines for our whole entire code base. So if you were to get your pull request, merge, it needed to have tests on it, that were fully testing your code. So It is something that you will most likely see at work and something that I really impress upon my students that it's it's an important thing to

**Unknown Speaker** 35:06  
do and learn. We did a whole episode on testing with Angie Jones. And so we didn't

**Ali** 35:13  
know we did a lesson we did an episode on teaching with her.

**Unknown Speaker** 35:17  
Oh, we did teaching.

**Unknown Speaker** 35:18  
Okay, well, anyway, she's really invested in testing, she does test automation University. So go check that out as well. But just to clarify, we actually were doing an episode of testing for ci nice. Okay, that's good to know. Just at a very high level, though, like snapshot testing, kind of like takes a snapshot of your UI and checks whether anything has changed visually. So has my button background changed from blue to red? If so, it'll throw an error. integration testing, kind of make sure that your new feature actually integrates with everything that already exists, I believe, and then end to end testing, I think actually tests user flows. But that being said, there are cases when you're not going to want to test certain things like if your test is very, very simplistic, it's actually more overhead. I think We'll talk about that more next season in our testing episode, but just things to be aware of so a couple people in the industry to check out So Andy Jones is a big one. Kent Dodds does a lot Kinsey does does a lot of work with testing as well, trying to think if there's anyone else off the top of my head who does a lot of testing. Okay, but I still have a question about this. Because like I said, like, I don't remember people talking about testing. Like,

**Unknown Speaker** 36:23  
a few years ago, never. It's very recent, is

**Unknown Speaker** 36:26  
it just because these these libraries or these tools to test only recently came about? Because people have been writing tests for the back end for a long time? I'm not sure.

**Ali** 36:36  
Yeah, I think it's becoming more of a thing on the front end as friends become more complex, like with front end development has been revolutionized pretty recently with the rise of like JavaScript frameworks. And it looks wildly different than it did even when I started my career in the front end, like it was mostly just you added a little bit of jQuery to make things interactive, and now it's like your whole entire user interfaces built in JavaScript. And so I think as that has come about testing has come about okay. And as well would be my guess is that it correlates with the rise in JavaScript use.

**Unknown Speaker** 37:13  
All right, let's go into tooling now. So I think we all have some of our favorite tools that we use. And when we talked about our was the episode called for, like all of our

**Unknown Speaker** 37:25  
computer setup in Arkham. Yes,

**Unknown Speaker** 37:26  
I think I yeah, I realized as soon as I said it, I know exactly what it is. So it did kind of cover some of these, these tools that we find to be really useful, like prettier, es lint, I meant understanding NPM and yarn. And do you have a preference on NPM versus yarn?

**Unknown Speaker** 37:47  
I don't know what the differences are, in all honesty, so I just use whichever one I kind of feel like, which is very bad practice, so I shouldn't learn.

**Ali** 37:54  
Now. I think that they're the same yarn came about because MPM was single threading, everything. So All of the packages would install one after the other, and yarn would parallelize them, I think so they would install at the same time. And then NPM started doing the same thing. So this point, yarn and NPM are pretty similar, at least in my understanding, but agreed I use whatever the project is using in usually NPM by default, if I'm starting something

**Unknown Speaker** 38:22  
with no GitHub, or NPM joined GitHub, right? Yeah, a couple weeks ago. So I use both. I'm understanding, you know, package managers and your node modules folder and how the jokes around why is the why they're so weighty. And making sure you're not pushing those to your GitHub repos, and things like that. Webpack and Gulp and grunt, I still have projects that use Gulp and grunts. And do you use this? Do you to use this? Yeah, yes, sir. So I think Hold on, let's pause. And let's give a quick overview of very high level overview of what some of these things are. Because it's very confusing if you don't know. So prettier is a tool that's used to format your code and make it look prettier. This is like aligning all of your indentations to be correct. Each line is created by Airbnb. And it's essentially a set of rules to govern how you write your code. This can be done on your like within your ID, but also at a project level. So this is do I want to use tabs or spaces, or do I want to use single quotes or double quotes, things like that? It

**Unknown Speaker** 39:33  
was built by Airbnb? I think so yeah.

**Unknown Speaker** 39:36  
That's cool. Emmet is a tool that comes integrated with VS code, if I'm not mistaken. And you can use the shorthand. Like, you can use shorthand, essentially, to write out scaffold a bunch of really complex HTML very easily, and it can expand beyond beyond HTML as well. Yeah, I can use like CSS. I haven't used it for anything above HTML, but yeah, Kelly's gonna write your own your own little scripts to, if you're if you're having the same things over and over again, like you could do this to create react functional. Yeah, for example. And so we touched on NPM and yarn, they're just package managers. So any package that someone creates so react, for example is a package that you would want to install in your code. Webpack is a very complex tool that's a little bit confusing to learn, but it kind of does everything. For me it replaced a gulp and grunt, gulp and grunt are task managers. And so that a task might be to transpile your code from e6 down to f5 for certain browsers, or to minify your code and strip out all the excess spacing and indentation Webpack kind of replaced it and it did a lot of other things. So if you're using create react app, it comes built in with Webpack. For example, you don't even have to configure it but I don't know enough about Webpack to actually talk I don't either, but I think it's worth saying well Webpack may have replaced it. Gulp and grunt are still very much around. They're still being active. To use and projects,

**Ali** 41:01  
definitely, I will also say that there are a lot of tools now for generating these things for you some something like create react app, which under the hood is using Webpack, or something like Gatsby, which does all of the configuration for you. Whereas back in the day like early react, you had to write all of this yourself. And it was gnarly. To me it was the most difficult part by far of learning react.

**Unknown Speaker** 41:27  
And that's exactly why I delayed learning react.

**Ali** 41:29  
Yeah, it was gnarly. But we have tools now it's a lot easier now.

**Unknown Speaker** 41:34  
So jumping into developer tools now, two things to look at here. First off the text or the ID that you're using. You know, whether you're using Sublime Text or atom or VS code, they all do. They, I mean, they all have the same end goal, but they all have their own unique little intricacies. It's it really comes down to personal preference what you like using best, so there's no right or wrong answer here. Except for Emma. She's really likes using just like TextEdit to code still? I do well, no, that's not true. I actually mostly code in vim, or just like on a circuit board directly. So

**Unknown Speaker** 42:12  
I like Microsoft Word

**Unknown Speaker** 42:17  
in any context.

**Ali** 42:21  
I got into that during whiteboarding interviews when they made me write my code in my Google Docs. I just stuck to it. I knew it.

**Unknown Speaker** 42:28  
I think it's really powerful because then you know, you you finished writing out your your code in Microsoft Word, then you go print off the paper, and then just like glue it to your monitor. And then you have a website cars. Great. Oh, punch. Those are nice. Exactly. So outside of the text editors, then you have the developer tools that are built into your browser. So whether you're using Safari, Firefox, Chrome, they are their dev tools are built right into the browser left out opera Kelly all of brave there. Oh, I don't even know if this Oh, go ahead and Ask on Twitter see say what is brave? Listen, like there is a community around people who use this particular browser who are so like such diehard fans about it. I don't completely understand this. I know it's really big on privacy. There's something with like, you can serve me ads, but then I get Bitcoin in return or something like that. I don't, it's a thing. I ain't gonna touch that with a 10 foot pole. That's a good plan. But understanding how to use the developer tools that are built into whichever browser you're using, or multiple browsers that you're using, especially when you're doing things like view and react, there are extensions you can add to chrome, for example, to be able to like click through each of the components. And it's super handy. Awkward silence. Let's talk about get let's talk about get no Kelly's right I didn't want to take like the spotlight was just totally right. I didn't know how to use the developer tools for like the first year of my career. So don't be like me, learn from me drink water and learn the browser developer tools. So get is a something really important you're going to need when you work on a team again I've never been asked questions in an interview nothing about I am conceptually if you are like do you have experience using get? I don't I don't I don't want you to know like, what is your favorite commit message actually just start asking that's a pretty fun question. I'll Honestly though I feel like that's a given like if you're working on like not so I'm not talking GitHub I'm talking yet which is like the actual like language for how you would navigate your like your its actual source control method and then GitHub and Bitbucket and I don't know what source tree like those are all IDs, not IDs. I'm totally losing my words, but they're like the actual tools that you would use to integrate with get. It's a little confusing. But yeah, I would say it's a given these days, like if you work as a web developer, you're expected to know good, I will say though, if you don't know get it can be pretty confusing trying to wrap your head around learning get yeah it's so freakin convincing Is there a lot of really great online courses for you know wrapping your head around getting understanding like creating branches and you know how you're you should be properly you know pushing up into into repository and creating the pull requests things like get blame and get rebase things like some of those topics. I'm still confused about them but there are a lot of really great courses online I don't think the linked to any so maybe we may or may not listen to one of the show notes. But yeah, don't panic if you start you like you're hearing a lot of people talk about like using it and you're like I really do not understand that you're in good company. I still don't know how to use get and every time I

**Unknown Speaker** 45:49  
screwed up I delete it.

**Unknown Speaker** 45:51  
I literally just started right.

**Unknown Speaker** 45:52  
I'm not even joking. Like that's Yeah, I joke about on Twitter, but I'm actually not kidding. I know I need to learn it. It's just there's a course. Burning masters about getting depth. And she actually talks about the shock codes that are generated for each commit message and like what it all means it's very interesting. But yeah, you definitely need to know get and kind of in line without knowing how to use your terminal as a big,

**Unknown Speaker** 46:13  
a big thing that you should at least

**Unknown Speaker** 46:15  
I can do like basic commands, like I can navigate my file structure. And I can use get in the terminal. Those are basically the only things I do in there. I don't touch your VM, I don't do anything else. So at least understand like, what is a terminal? Why would I use that? How do I navigate basic file structures and I think you should be pretty good on that end,

**Ali** 46:33  
Agreed. Agreed. I have my terminal use it for a lot of things. But honestly recently, I've been using VS code more for my file management stuff. It's got so many amazing tools for that. And for me, it's just easier to stay in one place rather than switch back over to my terminal.

**Unknown Speaker** 46:53  
I agree. I use I use hyper for my terminal. And basically I use it whenever I'm starting a new project to Get cloned something and then open up VS code, and then I close it. And then I go just use a terminal is built into vs. Code. Yeah. Yeah. I feel that though. Emma, do you want to talk about design patterns? Why? Because designs in the title Kelly? Yes. Yeah, sure. So basically, design patterns have nothing really to do with visual design. But essentially, they are cookie cutters for structuring your code. There are different design patterns. The builder pattern is one. And I think the basic premise of it is it talks about how you can create essentially rubber stamps for your code. You build a component and every time you need it, you just stamp a specific component. I don't know enough about it to actually do it justice. But Addy osmani, who works at Google Chrome is a huge proponent of design patterns. He wrote a book, it's excellent, go check it out. You don't need to be experts in design patterns. I don't know anything about design patterns, and I'm doing just fine with my life. But it is something if you want to level up your web developer skills or just Your programming skills in general, because it's not web specific, I would definitely recommend checking out his book. Without I think we've kind of touched all of the primary areas for web development. But I do think it's important, we very quickly discuss data structures and algorithms, because you're going to need to know these 100% for your interviews, and we did an episode on, we did three episodes on the front end interview process. So go check those out. But one of those was around data structures and algorithms. And Gosh, it's a lot. It's very heavy, and it's overwhelming. But there are things that you absolutely need to know. I don't know anything about data structures and algorithms. Even after recording that episode. I won't lie I it's an area that's just complete magic to me. But outside of our own episode, Kyle shevlin also has an egghead course on data structures and algorithms that is worth checking out. We will link to that in our show notes. Okay, so we listed a ton of stuff in this episode. We're We've been talking a lot about front end back end testing, tooling, etc. So let's talk about leveling up past the basics because, you know, you can go through tutorials, you can go through courses, but how do you move past that? And I'd love to hear from Ollie for this as our resident teacher.

**Ali** 49:19  
Yeah, I think the most important thing that you can do is learn by doing and building applied projects and different projects than you would from a tutorial. So if you're learning through to do lists in a tutorial, build something totally different, and apply your skills in a different format that's going to test you a lot more than just recreating something over and over again. In addition, use tutorials to learn the fundamentals but don't get stuck in a cycle of just doing tutorial after tutorial after tutorial of never going beyond that, especially if you are like self taught building something like a portfolio or having a blog is going to be really important to show off your skills or if You're a bootcamp grad as well, for the most part, having something like a portfolio is going to be probably crucial for getting your first job. So building projects that you can feature on that portfolio is going to be

**Unknown Speaker** 50:11  
and if you're not sure of what to build, and you're looking into JavaScript, I really like the JavaScript 30. I don't know if I guess if he maybe considered a course, from West boss, where basically, it's a different JavaScript project every 30 or like, for every day for 30 days, using vanilla JavaScript. And you can kind of use this as a launching point for building something on your own. If you just need some ideas.

**Ali** 50:36  
Yeah, they're good little drills pretty quick, too. And I want to end this episode with a couple of disclaimers. So again, everybody's path is different. Everything is going to be it was different for all the three of us we all do different things before getting our first developer jobs. We all know very different things now and have very different specialization. So everybody's path is going to be different. So you don't need to know absolutely everything that we outlined in this episode. I think it's just good to have this basic roadmap of here are some things that I should maybe learn if I'm looking to get started. And along the same lines, you don't have to learn them all at once. Pace yourself, and take some time. You know, there are those stories online. It's like I learned how to code in a week and became a developer that makes \$800,000 a year and that's not the usual case, it usually takes a while to learn these things. Everybody's path is going to be so different. Also, with everything going on in the world. I know that I've made these disclaimers all through the last episode, but if you're not feeling it right now, and you're not using this quarantine time to learn to code or anything like that, that is okay. That is actually super, super understandable. I understand it. I am in New York City where things are basically apocalyptic and It's tough to even get out of bed in the morning, I can link a article in the show notes of right now it's your job to survive. It's not. We're not in conditions right now where many people are thriving. So don't feel like you need to use this quarantine time that you have more time at home to teach yourself all of these things or anything like that, do what feels best to you.

**Unknown Speaker** 52:20  
And on that note, let's jump into shoutouts. So I'm going to start with Emma first what is your shout out? You're starting with me because my shout out I know. That's exactly why

**Unknown Speaker** 52:31  
I'm now Kelly helped my mom set up a business. Well, okay, hold on. Wait. She mentored her for her birthday on setting up a business. My mom just retired from IBM after 30 some odd years as a UX designer. So she's now starting her own businesses, like a career coach or something. She works with john Maxwell, to some extent, but in any case, she's trying to set up her own LLC and Kelly is the queen of LLC so I for her birthday purchased a session with Kelly and so I just That was my shout out

**Unknown Speaker** 53:01  
thank you people collect things like baseball cards and rocks. I collect LLCs

**Unknown Speaker** 53:10  
Allie, what is your shout out?

**Ali** 53:13  
My shout out is to my dog Blair because I have again in New York City right now have been under the weather and so completely self isolating and if I I live alone so if I did not have my dog Blair things would be really rough right now but she's, she's there for me and she keeps throwing tennis balls at me all day keeps the mood light. So big shout out to Blair. That's cute. And Kelly,

**Unknown Speaker** 53:41  
my shout out is to coffee.

**Unknown Speaker** 53:44  
I ran out of coffee last week. And it was a really, really sad moment in my life. And so I bought some from a local roaster and then my uncle also mailed me a bag of coffee from Michigan and sometimes How I went from having no coffee to having 11 pounds of coffee. But I'm really excited to be enjoying this this coffee because I finally bought and aeropress again and it is my favorite way to make coffee. So on that note Let's close out so if you liked this episode tweet about it. Um, we have been sending a Smashing Magazine book to tweeters, but given the current state of things, we're not going to the post office so either we will give you a Smashing Magazine when or book when we're venturing out into the world again, or we'll find something other something else that's kind of fun, but either way, if you liked this episode, please tweet about it. We also started a book club. So we just last week we released our third book club episode which was on it doesn't have to be crazy at work. Go listen to that if you haven't yet. Mays book club book is outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. We're not doing one for April since we're taking a month off. But if you're interested in joining in, you can learn more by going to leap By the dot dev slash books, and as we are at the end of season two, we will be taking the remainder of April off to prepare for the next great season for you. We have a lot of really great content lined up for season three. Super excited. We cannot wait to share so we'll be back on your favorite podcasting app on May 4. Awesome beer well, Bye, everybody.

**Emma** 55:36  
It's a beautiful day to be alive.
